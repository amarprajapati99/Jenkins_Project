IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
I..Numeral : In Hindu Arabic system, we use ten symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
called digits to represent any number. 
 A group of digits, denoting a number is called a numeral. 
 We represent a number, say 689745132 as shown below :

We read it as : 'Sixty-eight crores, ninety-seven lacs, forty-five thousand, one hundred 
and thirty-two'.  
II  Place Value or Local Value of a Digit in a Numeral : 
In the above numeral : 
Place value of 2 is (2 x 1) = 2; Place value of 3 is (3 x 10) = 30;  
Place value of 1 is (1 x 100) = 100 and so on. 
Place value of 6 is 6 x 108 = 600000000  
III.Face Value : The face value of a digit in a numeral is the value of the   digit itself 
at whatever place it may be. In the above numeral, the face value of 2 is 2; the face 
value of 3 is 3 and so on. 
IV.TYPES OF NUMBERS 
1.Natural Numbers : Counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,..... are called natural 
numbers. 
2.Whole Numbers : All counting numbers together with zero form the set of whole 
numbers. Thus, 
        (i) 0 is the only whole number which is not a natural number.  
        (ii) Every natural number is a whole number. 
3.Integers : All natural numbers, 0 and negatives of counting numbers i.e., 
{…, - 3 , - 2 , - 1 ,  0, 1, 2, 3,…..} together form the set of integers. 
(i) Positive Integers : {1, 2, 3, 4, …..} is the set of all positive integers. 
(ii) Negative Integers : {- 1, - 2, - 3,…..} is the set of all negative integers. 
(iii) Non-Positive and Non-Negative Integers : 0 is neither positive nor 
negative. So, {0, 1, 2, 3,….} represents the set of non-negative integers, while 
{0, - 1 , - 2 , - 3 , …..} represents the set of non-positive integers. 
4.  Even Numbers : A number divisible by 2 is called an even number, e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 
10, etc. 
5.  Odd Numbers : A number not divisible by 2 is called an odd number. e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 
9, 11, etc. 
6.  Prime Numbers : A number greater than 1 is called a prime number, if it has exactly 
two factors, namely 1 and the number itself. 
Prime numbers upto 100 are : 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 
47,  53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. 
Prime numbers Greater than 100 : Let p be a given number greater than 100. To find out 
whether it is prime or not, we use the following method : 
Find a whole number nearly greater than the square root of p. Let k > *jp. Test whether p 
is divisible by any prime number less than k. If yes, then p is not prime. Otherwise, p is 
prime. 
e.g,,We have to find whether 191 is a prime number or not. Now, 14 > V191. 
Prime numbers less than 14 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. 
191 is not divisible by any of them. So, 191 is a prime number. 
7.Composite Numbers : Numbers greater than 1 which are not prime, are known as 
composite numbers, e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. 
Note :    (i) 1 is neither prime nor composite. 
(ii) 2 is the only even number which is prime.  
(iii) There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100. 
8.  Co-primes : Two numbers a and b are said to be co-primes, if their H.C.F. is 1. e.g., 
(2, 3), (4, 5), (7, 9), (8, 11), etc. are co-primes, 
V.TESTS OF DIVISIBILITY 
1.  Divisibility By 2 : A number is divisible by 2, if its unit's digit is any of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. 
Ex. 84932 is divisible by 2, while 65935 is not. 
2.  Divisibility By 3 : A number is divisible by 3, if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. 
Ex.592482 is divisible by 3, since sum of its digits = (5 + 9 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 2) = 30, which 
is divisible by 3. 
But, 864329 is not divisible by 3, since sum of its digits =(8 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 9) = 32, 
which is not divisible by 3. 
3.  Divisibility By 4 : A number is divisible by 4, if the number formed by the last two 
digits is divisible by 4. 
Ex. 892648 is divisible by 4, since the number formed by the last two digits is 
48,  which is divisible by 4. 
But, 749282 is not divisible by 4, since the number formed by the last tv/o digits is 82, 
which is not divisible by 4. 
4.  Divisibility By 5 : A number is divisible by 5, if its unit's digit is either 0 or 5. Thus, 
20820 and 50345 are divisible by 5, while 30934 and 40946 are not. 
5.  Divisibility By 6 : A number is divisible by 6, if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Ex. 
The number 35256 is clearly divisible by 2. 
Sum of its digits = (3 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 6) = 21, which is divisible by 3. Thus, 35256 is 
divisible by 2 as well as 3. Hence, 35256 is divisible by 6. 
6.   Divisibility By 8 : A number is divisible by 8, if the number formed by the last 
three digits of the given number is divisible by 8. 
Ex. 953360 is divisible by 8, since the number formed by last three digits is 360, which is 
divisible by 8. 
But, 529418 is not divisible by 8, since the number formed by last three digits is 418, 
which is not divisible by 8. 
7.   Divisibility By 9 : A number is divisible by 9, if the sum of its digits is divisible 
by 9. 
Ex. 60732 is divisible by 9, since sum of digits * (6 + 0 + 7 + 3 + 2) = 18, which is 
divisible by 9. 
But, 68956 is not divisible by 9, since sum of digits = (6 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 6) = 34, which is 
not divisible by 9. 
8.   Divisibility By 10 : A number is divisible by 10, if it ends with 0. 
Ex. 96410, 10480 are divisible by 10, while 96375 is not. 
9.   Divisibility By 11 : A number is divisible by 11, if the difference of the sum of its 
digits at odd places and the sum of its digits at even places, is either 0 or a number 
divisible by 11. 
Ex. The number 4832718 is divisible by 11, since : 
(sum of digits at odd places) - (sum of digits at even places) 
(8 + 7 + 3 + 4) - (1 + 2 + 8) = 11, which is divisible by 11. 
10.  Divisibility By 12 ; A number is divisible by 12, if it is divisible by both 4 and 
3. 
Ex. Consider the number 34632. 
(i) The number formed by last two digits is 32, which is divisible by 4,  
(ii) Sum of digits = (3 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 2) = 18, which is divisible by 3. Thus, 34632 is 
divisible by 4 as well as 3. Hence, 34632 is divisible by 12. 
11.   Divisibility By 14 : A number is divisible by 14, if it is divisible by 2 as well as 7. 
12.  Divisibility By 15 : A number is divisible by 15, if it is divisible by both 3 and 5. 
13.  Divisibility By 16 : A number is divisible by 16, if the number formed by the last4  
digits is divisible by 16. 
Ex.7957536 is divisible by 16, since the number formed by the last four digits is 7536, 
which is divisible by 16. 
14.  Divisibility By 24 : A given number is divisible by 24, if it is divisible by both3  and 
8. 
15.  Divisibility By 40 : A given number is divisible by 40, if it is divisible by both 
5  and 8. 
16.  Divisibility By 80 : A given number is divisible by 80, if it is divisible by both 5 and 
16. 
Note : If a number is divisible by p as well as q, where p and q are co-primes, then the 
given number is divisible by pq. 
If p arid q are not co-primes, then the given number need not be divisible by pq, 
even when it is divisible by both p and q. 
Ex. 36 is divisible by both 4 and 6, but it is not divisible by (4x6) = 24, since 
4  and 6 are not co-primes. 
 
 
 
 
 
VI   MULTIPLICATION BY SHORT CUT METHODS 
1.  Multiplication By Distributive Law : 
(i) a x (b + c) = a x b + a x c    (ii) ax(b-c) = a x b-a x c. 
Ex.   (i) 567958 x 99999 = 567958 x (100000 - 1) 
= 567958 x 100000 - 567958 x 1 = (56795800000 - 567958) = 56795232042. (ii) 978 x 
184 + 978 x 816 = 978 x (184 + 816) = 978 x 1000 = 978000. 
2.  Multiplication of a Number By 5n :  Put n zeros to the right of the multiplicand and 
divide the number so formed by 2n 
Ex. 975436 x 625 = 975436 x 54= 9754360000 =   609647600 
                                                            16  
VII.   BASIC FORMULAE 
1. (a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab                      2. (a - b)2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab 
3. (a + b)2 - (a - b)2 = 4ab                       4. (a + b)2 + (a - b)2 = 2 (a2 + b2) 
5.  (a2 - b2) = (a + b) (a - b) 
6.  (a + b + c)2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2 (ab + bc + ca) 
7.  (a3 + b3) = (a +b) (a2 - ab + b2)        8. (a3 - b3) = (a - b) (a2 + ab + b2)  
9. (a3 + b3 + c3 -3abc) = (a + b + c) (a2 + b2 + c2 - ab - bc - ca) 
10. If a + b + c = 0, then a3 + b3 + c3 = 3abc.  
 
VIII.  DIVISION ALGORITHM OR EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM  
If we divide a given number by another number, then : 
Dividend = (Divisor x Quotient) + Remainder 
IX.     {i) (xn - an ) is divisible by (x - a) for all values of n. 
           (ii) (xn - an) is divisible by (x + a) for all even values of n.  
           (iii) (xn + an) is divisible by (x + a) for all odd values of n. 
 
X. PROGRESSION 
A succession of numbers formed and arranged in a definite order according to certain 
definite rule, is called a progression. 
1. Arithmetic Progression (A.P.) : If each term of a progression differs from its 
preceding term by a constant, then such a progression is called an arithmetical 
progression. This constant difference is called the common difference of the A.P. 
An A.P. with first term a and common difference d is given by a, (a + d), (a + 2d),(a + 
3d),..... 
The nth term of this A.P. is given by Tn =a (n - 1) d. 
The sum of n terms of this A.P. 
Sn = n/2 [2a + (n - 1) d] = n/2   (first term + last term). 
 
SOME IMPORTANT RESULTS : 
 
 (i) (1 + 2 + 3 +…. + n) =n(n+1)/2 
(ii) (l2 + 22 + 32 + ... + n2) = n (n+1)(2n+1)/6 
(iii)  (13 + 23 + 33 + ... + n3) =n2(n+1)2 
 
 
2.   Geometrical Progression (G.P.) : A progression of numbers in which every term 
bears a constant ratio with its preceding term, is called a geometrical progression. 
The constant ratio is called the common ratio of the G.P. A G.P. with first term a and 
common ratio r is : 
a, ar, ar2, 
In this G.P. Tn = arn-1 
sum of the n terms, Sn=   a(1-rn) 
                                          (1-r)

 Ex. 9. Find the unit's digit in the product (2467)163 x (341)72.  
Sol. Clearly, unit's digit in the given product = unit's digit in 7153 x 172.                                   
       Now, 74 gives unit digit 1. 
       7152  gives unit digit 1, 
  ? 7153  gives unit digit (l x 7) = 7. Also, 172 gives unit digit 1.  
       Hence, unit's digit in the product = (7 x 1) = 7. 
 
 
Ex. 10. Find the unit's digit in (264)102 + (264)103 
Sol. Required unit's digit = unit's digit in (4)102 + (4)103. 
       Now, 42  gives unit digit 6. 
   ?(4)102 gives unjt digit 6. 
   ?(4)103 gives unit digit of the product (6 x 4) i.e., 4.  
       Hence, unit's digit in (264)m + (264)103 = unit's digit in (6 + 4) = 0. 
 
 
 Ex. 11. Find the total number of prime factors in the expression (4)11 x (7)5 x (11)2.

divisible by 4. 
Hence, 618703572 is divisible by 4. 
 
 
 
 
 
Ex. 16. Which digits should come in place of * and $ if the number 62684*$ is 
divisible by both 8 and 5 ? 
Sol.      
Since the given number is divisible by 5, so 0 or 5 must come in place of $. But, a 
number ending with 5 is never divisible by 8. So, 0 will replace $.  
Now, the number formed by the last three digits is 4*0, which becomes divisible by 8, if 
* is replaced by 4. 
Hence, digits in place of * and $ are 4 and 0 respectively.

2. H.C.F. AND L.C.M. OF NUMBERS 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
I.  Factors and Multiples : If a number a divides another number b exactly, we say that a 
is a factor of b. In this case, b is called a multiple of a. 
II. Highest Common Factor (H.C.F.) or Greatest Common Measure (G.C.M.) or 
Greatest Common Divisor (G.C.D.): The H.C.F. of two or more than two numbers is 
the greatest number that divides each of them exactly.  
   There are two methods of finding the H.C.F. of a given set of numbers : 
1.  Factorization Method : Express each one of the given numbers as the product 
of prime factors.The product of least powers of common prime factors gives H.C.F. 
2.  Division Method: Suppose we have to find the H.C.F. of two given numbers. 
Divide the larger   number by the smaller one. Now, divide the divisor by the 
remainder. Repeat the process of dividing the preceding number by the remainder 
last obtained till zero is obtained as remainder. The last divisor is the required 
H.C.F.   
Finding the H.C.F. of more than two numbers : Suppose we have to find the 
H.C.F. of three numbers. Then, H.C.F. of [(H.C.F. of any two) and (the third 
number)] gives the H.C.F. of three given numbers. 
Similarly, the H.C.F. of more than three numbers may be obtained.  
III.  Least Common Multiple (L.C.M.) : The least number which is exactly divisible by 
each one of the given numbers is called their L.C.M. 
1.  Factorization Method of Finding L.C.M.: Resolve each one of the given 
numbers into a product of prime factors. Then, L.C.M. is the product of highest 
powers of all the factors, 
2.  Common Division Method {Short-cut Method) of Finding L.C.M.: 
Arrange the given numbers in a row in any order. Divide by a number which 
divides exactly at least two of the given numbers and carry forward the numbers 
which are not divisible. Repeat the above process till no two of the numbers are 
divisible by the same number except 1. The product of the divisors and the 
undivided numbers is the required L.C.M. of the given numbers, 
IV. Product of two numbers =Product of their H.C.F. and L.C.M.  
V. Co-primes: Two numbers are said to be co-primes if their H.C.F. is 1.  
VI. H.C.F. and L.C.M. of Fractions: 
1.H C F= H.C.F. of Numerators         2.L C M =      L.C.M  of Numerators__ 
     L.C.M. of Denominators                           H.C.F. of Denominators 
VII. H.C.F. and L.C.M. of Decimal Fractions: In given numbers, make the same 
number of decimal places by annexing zeros in some numbers, if necessary. Considering 
these numbers without decimal point, find H.C.F. or L.C.M. as the case may be. Now, in 
the result, mark off as many decimal places as are there in each of the given numbers. 
VIII. Comparison of Fractions: Find the L.C.M. of the denominators of the given 
fractions. Convert each of the fractions into an equivalent fraction with L.C.M. as the 
denominator, by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same number. 
The resultant fraction with the greatest numerator is the greatest.

5 1 -   7 -     4 -   3   -   2 
 1 -    7 -     2 -   3   -   1 
 
?L.C.M = 3 X 2 X 2 X 7 X 2 X 3 = 504. 
Hence required number = (504 +1) = 505. 
 
Ex.17. Find the largest number of four digits exactly divisible by 12,15,18 and 27. 
Sol. The Largest number of four digits is 9999. 
       Required number must be divisible by L.C.M. of 12,15,18,27 i.e. 540. 
      On dividing 9999 by 540,we get 279 as remainder . 
   ?Required number = (9999-279) = 9720. 
 
 
Ex.18.Find the smallest number of five digits exactly divisible by 16,24,36 and 54. 
Sol. Smallest number of five digits is 10000. 
       Required number must be divisible by L.C.M. of 16,24,36,54 i.e 432, 
       On dividing 10000 by 432,we get 64 as remainder. 
    ?Required number = 10000 +( 432 – 64 ) = 10368. 
 
Ex.19.Find the least number which when divided by 20,25,35 and 40 leaves 
remainders 14,19,29 and 34 respectively. 
Sol. Here,(20-14) = 6,(25 – 19)=6,(35-29)=6 and (40-34)=6. 
    ?Required number = (L.C.M. of 20,25,35,40) – 6 =1394.

3, but when divided by 9 leaves no remainder . 
Sol. L.C.M. of 5,6,7,8 = 840. 
   ? Required number is of the form 840k + 3 
     Least value of k for which (840k + 3) is divisible by 9 is k = 2. 
 ?Required number = (840 X 2 + 3)=1683 
 
Ex.21.The traffic lights at three different road crossings change after every 48 sec.,

hours,then at what time they again change simultaneously . 
Sol. Interval of change = (L.C.M of 48,72,108)sec.=432sec. 
       So, the lights will agin change simultaneously after every 432 seconds i.e,7 
min.12sec 
       Hence , next simultaneous change will take place at 8:27:12 hrs. 
 
Ex.22.Arrange the fractions 17   , 31, 43, 59   in the ascending order. 
18   36   45  60 
Sol.L.C.M. of 18,36,45 and 60 = 180. 
Now, 17 = 17 X 10 = 170  ;   31 =   31 X 5    = 155 ; 
          18     18 X 10    180     36      36 X 5        180 
 
          43 = 43 X 4 = 172  ;   59  = 59 X 3    = 177 ;  
          45     45 X 4    180     60     60 X 3        180 
 
Since, 155<170<172<177, so, 155 < 170 < 172 < 177 
                                                 180    180    180     180

3. DECIMAL FRACTIONS 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
I.    Decimal Fractions : Fractions in which denominators are powers of 10 are known as decimal  
fractions.    
                   Thus ,1/10=1 tenth=.1;1/100=1 hundredth =.01; 
                    99/100=99 hundreths=.99;7/1000=7 thousandths=.007,etc 
II.  Conversion of a Decimal Into Vulgar Fraction : Put 1 in the denominator under the decimal 
point and annex with it as many zeros as is the number of digits after the decimal point. Now, 
remove the decimal point and reduce the fraction to its lowest terms. 
 
Thus, 0.25=25/100=1/4;2.008=2008/1000=251/125. 
    
III.  1.  Annexing zeros to the extreme right of a decimal fraction does not change its value 
            Thus, 0.8 = 0.80 = 0.800, etc. 
 
2.  If numerator and denominator of a fraction contain the same number of decimal 
     places, then we remove the decimal sign. 
         Thus,   1.84/2.99 = 184/299 = 8/13;    0.365/0.584 = 365/584=5 
 
IV.  Operations on Decimal Fractions : 
 
1. Addition and Subtraction of Decimal Fractions : The given numbers are so 
placed under each other that the decimal points lie in one column. The numbers 
so arranged can now be added or subtracted in the usual way. 
 
2. Multiplication of a Decimal Fraction By a Power of 10 : Shift the decimal 
point to the right by as many places as is the power of 10. 
Thus, 5.9632 x 100 = 596,32; 0.073 x 10000 = 0.0730 x 10000 = 730. 
 
3.Multiplication of Decimal Fractions : Multiply the given numbers considering 
them without the decimal point. Now, in the product, the decimal point is marked 
off to obtain as many places of decimal as is the sum of the number of decimal 
places in the given numbers. 
Suppose we have to find the product (.2 x .02 x .002). Now, 2x2x2 = 8. Sum of 
decimal places = (1 + 2 + 3) = 6. .2 x .02 x .002 = .000008. 
 
4.Dividing a Decimal Fraction By a Counting Number : Divide the given 
number without considering the decimal point, by the given counting number. 
Now, in the quotient, put the decimal point to give as many places of decimal as 
there are in the dividend. 
Suppose we have to find the quotient (0.0204 + 17). Now, 204 ^ 17 = 12. Dividend contains 
4 places of decimal. So, 0.0204 + 17 = 0.0012. 
 
 
5. Dividing a Decimal Fraction By a Decimal Fraction : Multiply both the dividend and the 
divisor by a suitable power of 10 to make divisor a whole number. Now, proceed as above. 
Thus, 0.00066/0.11 = (0.00066*100)/(0.11*100) = (0.066/11) = 0.006V  
 
V.  Comparison of Fractions : Suppose some fractions are to be arranged in ascending or 
descending order of magnitude. Then, convert each one of the given fractions in the decimal form, 
and arrange them accordingly. 
 
Suppose, we have to arrange the fractions  3/5, 6/7 and 7/9  in descending order. 
  
    now, 3/5=0.6,6/7 = 0.857,7/9 = 0.777.... 
 
     since  0.857>0.777...>0.6, so 6/7>7/9>3/5 
 
VI. Recurring Decimal : If in a decimal fraction, a figure or a set of figures is repeated 
continuously, then such a number is called a recurring decimal. 
In a recurring decimal, if a single figure is repeated, then it is expressed by putting a dot on it. 
If a set of figures is repeated, it is expressed by putting a bar on the set 
               ______  
Thus 1/3 = 0.3333….= 0.3;  22 /7 = 3.142857142857.....= 3.142857 
Pure Recurring Decimal: A decimal fraction in which all the figures after the decimal point 
are repeated, is called a pure recurring decimal. 
 
Converting a Pure Recurring Decimal Into Vulgar Fraction : Write the repeated figures 
only once in the numerator and take as many nines in the denominator as is the number of 
repeating figures. 
 
thus ,0.5 = 5/9;  0.53 = 53/59  ;0.067 = 67/999;etc... 
 
 
Mixed Recurring Decimal: A decimal fraction in which some figures do not repeat and some 
of them are repeated, is called a mixed recurring decimal. 
e.g., 0.17333 . = 0.173. 
 
Converting a Mixed Recurring Decimal Into Vulgar Fraction : In the numerator, take the 
difference between the number formed by all the digits after decimal point (taking repeated 
digits only once) and that formed by the digits which are not repeated, In the denominator, 
take the number formed by as many nines as there are repeating digits followed by as many 
zeros as is the number of non-repeating digits. 
 
Thus 0.16 = (16-1) / 90 =  15/19 =  1/6; 
    ____ 
                0.2273 =  (2273 – 22)/9900 = 2251/9900

4. SIMPLIFICATION 
 
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS 
 
I. ’BODMAS’Rule: This rule depicts the correct sequence in which the operations are to be 
executed,so as to find out the value of a given expression. 
 
Here, ‘B’ stands for ’bracket’ ,’O’for ‘of’ , ‘D’ for’  division’  and ‘M’ for ‘multiplication’, ‘A’ 
for ‘addition’ and ‘S’ for ‘subtraction’. 
Thus, in simplifying an expression, first of all the brackets must be removed, strictly in the 
order(), {} and []. 
 
After removing the brackets, we must use the following operations strictly in the order: 
(1)of (2)division (3) multiplication (4)addition (5)subtraction. 
 
II. Modulus of a real number : Modulus of a real number a is defined as  
     |a| ={a, if a>0 
    -a, if a<0 
 Thus, |5|=5 and |-5|=-(-5)=5. 
III. Virnaculum (or bar): When an expression contains Virnaculum, before applying the 
‘BODMAS’ rule, we simplify the expression under the Virnaculum.

SQUARE ROOTS AND CUBE ROOTS 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
Square Root: If x
2
 = y, we say that the square root of y is x and we write, ?y = x. 
Thus, ?4 = 2, ?9 = 3, ?196 = 14. 
Cube Root: The cube root of a given number x is the number whose cube is x. We denote the cube 
root of x by 
3?x. 
Thus, 
3?8  = 
3?2 x 2 x 2 = 2, 
3?343 = 
3?7 x 7 x 7 = 7 etc. 
Note: 
1.?xy = ?x * ?y                     2. ?(x/y) = ?x / ?y  = (?x / ?y) * (?y / ?y) = ?xy / y

Ex. 2. Find the square root of 1471369.                                                     
 Sol.    Explanation: In the given number, mark off the digits              1  1471369 (1213 
in pairs starting from the unit's digit. Each pair and                        1               
the remaining one digit is called a period.                                22     47 
Now, 1
2
 = 1. On subtracting, we get 0 as remainder.                        44 
Now, bring down the next period i.e., 47.                               241      313 
Now, trial divisor is 1 x 2 = 2 and trial dividend is 47.                       241 
So, we take 22 as divisor and put 2 as quotient.                    2423        7269 
The remainder is 3.                                                                                7269 
Next, we bring down the next period which is 13.                                  x 
Now, trial divisor is 12 x 2 = 24 and trial dividend is  
313. So, we take 241 as dividend and 1 as quotient.  
The remainder is 72.  
Bring down the next period i.e., 69. 
Now, the trial divisor is 121 x 2 = 242 and the trial  
dividend is 7269. So, we take 3as quotient and 2423 
as divisor. The remainder is then zero. 
Hence, ?1471369 = 1213.

Sol. Let the average after 17th inning = x. 
 Then, average after 16th inning = (x - 3). 
:. 16 (x - 3) + 87 = 17x or x = (87 - 48) = 39. 
 
Ex.15. Distance between two stations A and B is 778 km. A train covers the journey 
from A to B at 84 km per hour and returns back to A with a uniform speed of 56 km 
perhour. Find the average speed of the train during the whole journey. 
Sol. Required average speed = ((2xy)/(x+y)) km / hr  
=(2 x 84 x 56)/(84+56)km/hr 
 = (2*84*56)/140 km/hr 
=67.2 km/hr.

2 – 9x – 4x + 6 = 0 => (3x – 2) (2x – 3) = 0 
? x = 2/3 or x = 3/2 
Hence the required number is 2/3 or 3/2. 
  
Ex. 4. The sum of two numbers is 184. If one-third of the one exceeds one-seventh 
of the other by 8, find the smaller number. 
       Sol.     Let the numbers be x and (184 - x). Then, 
 (X/3) - ((184 – x)/7) = 8 => 7x – 3(184 – x) = 168 => 10x = 720 => x = 72. 
      So, the numbers are 72 and 112. Hence, smaller number = 72. 
 
Ex. 5. The difference of two numbers is 11 and one-fifth of their sum is 9. Find the numbers. 
Sol.     Let the number be x and y. Then, 
            x – y = 11      ----(i)     and 1/5 (x + y) = 9  => x + y = 45              ----(ii) 
           Adding (i) and (ii), we get: 2x = 56 or x = 28. Putting x = 28 in (i), we get: y = 17. 
            Hence, the numbers are 28 and 17. 
 
Ex. 6. If the sum of two numbers is 42 and their product is 437, then find the 
absolute  difference between the numbers. (S.S.C. 2003) 
Sol.      Let the numbers be x and y. Then, x + y = 42 and xy = 437 
            x - y = sqrt[(x + y)
2
 - 4xy] = sqrt[(42)
2
 - 4 x 437 ] = sqrt[1764 – 1748] = sqrt[16] = 4. 
     Required difference = 4. 
Ex. 7. The sum of two numbers is 16 and the sum of their squares is 113. Find the  
numbers. 
         Sol.     Let the numbers be x and (15 - x). 
          Then, x
2
 + (15 - x)
2
 = 113           => x
2
 + 225 + X
2
 - 30x = 113  
           =>       2x
2
 - 30x + 112 = 0         =>    x
2
 - 15x + 56 = 0 
           =>       (x - 7) (x - 8) = 0             =>      x = 7  or  x = 8. 
           So, the numbers are 7 and 8. 
 
Ex. 8. The average  of  four consecutive even numbers is 27. Find the largest of these 
numbers. 
Sol.     Let the four consecutive even numbers be x, x + 2, x + 4 and x + 6. 
           Then, sum of these numbers = (27 x 4) = 108. 
           So, x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) = 108  or  4x = 96  or  x = 24. 
      :. Largest number = (x + 6) = 30. 
 
Ex. 9. The sum of the squares of three consecutive odd numbers is 2531.Find the 
numbers.  
         Sol.     Let the numbers be x, x + 2 and x + 4. 
           Then, X
2
 + (x + 2)
2
 + (x + 4)
2
 = 2531 => 3x
2
 + 12x - 2511 = 0 
            =>     X
2
 + 4x - 837 = 0 => (x - 27) (x + 31) = 0 => x = 27. 
            Hence, the required numbers are 27, 29 and 31. 
 
Ex. 10. Of two numbers, 4 times the smaller one is less then 3 times the 1arger one by 5. If the 
sum of  the numbers is larger than 6 times their difference by 6, find the two numbers. 
         Sol.     Let the numbers be x and y, such that x > y 
           Then, 3x - 4y = 5 ...(i)  and  (x + y) - 6 (x - y) = 6 =>  -5x + 7y = 6     …(ii) 
            Solving (i) and (ii), we get: x = 59 and  y = 43. 
            Hence, the required numbers are 59 and 43. 
 
Ex. 11. The ratio between a two-digit number and the sum of the digits of that 
number is 4 : 1.If the digit in the unit's place is 3 more than the digit in the ten’s place, what 
is the number? 
Sol.      Let the ten's digit be x. Then, unit's digit = (x + 3). 
            Sum of the digits = x + (x + 3) = 2x + 3. Number = l0x + (x + 3) = llx + 3. 
            11x+3 / 2x + 3  = 4 / 1 => 1lx + 3 = 4 (2x + 3)    =>  3x = 9      => x = 3. 
            Hence, required number = 11x + 3 = 36. 
 
Ex. 12. A number consists of two digits. The sum of the digits is 9. If 63  is subtracted 
from the number, its digits are interchanged. Find the number. 
Sol.      Let the ten's digit be x. Then, unit's digit = (9 - x). 
            Number = l0x + (9 - x) = 9x + 9. 
            Number obtained by reversing the digits = 10 (9 - x) + x = 90 - 9x. 
therefore, (9x + 9) - 63 = 90 - 9x    => 18x = 144   => x = 8. 
            So, ten's digit = 8 and unit's digit = 1. 
            Hence, the required number is 81. 
Ex. 13. A fraction becomes 2/3 when 1 is added to both, its numerator and denominator.  
And ,it becomes 1/2 when 1 is subtracted from both the numerator and  denominator. Find 
the fraction. 
Sol.      Let the required fraction be x/y. Then, 
 x+1 / y+1 = 2 / 3  =>  3x – 2y = - 1   …(i) and   x – 1 / y – 1 = 1 / 2  
? 2x – y = 1 …(ii) 
Solving (i) and (ii), we get : x = 3 , y = 5 
therefore, Required fraction= 3 / 5. 
 
Ex. 14. 50 is divided into two parts such that the sum of their reciprocals is 1/ 12.Find the two 
parts. 
Sol.      Let the two parts be x and  (50 - x). 
            Then, 1 / x + 1 / (50 – x) = 1 / 12 => (50 – x + x) / x ( 50 – x) = 1 / 12  
                    => x
2
 – 50x + 600 = 0 => (x – 30) ( x – 20) = 0 => x = 30 or x = 20. 
So, the parts are 30 and 20. 
 
Ex. 15. If three numbers are added in pairs, the sums equal 10, 19 and 21. Find the 
numbers     ) 
Sol.       Let the numbers be x, y and z. Then, 
     x+ y = 10 ...(i) y + z = 19 ...(ii)       x + z = 21       …(iii) 
Adding (i) ,(ii) and (iii), we get:  2 (x + y + z ) = 50 or  (x + y + z) = 25. 
Thus, x= (25 - 19) = 6;  y = (25 - 21) = 4;  z = (25 - 10) = 15. 
Hence, the required numbers are 6, 4 and 15. 
 
8. PROBLEMS ON AGES 
 
Ex. 1. Rajeev's age after 15 years will be 5 times his age 5 years back. What is the  
present age of Rajeev ?        (Hotel Management,2002) 
  
 Sol. Let Rajeev's present age be x years. Then, 
 Rajeev's age after 15 years = (x + 15) years. 
 Rajeev's age 5 years back = (x - 5) years. 
 :. x + 15 = 5 (x - 5)?x + 15 = 5x - 25 ? 4x = 40 ? x = 10. 
 Hence, Rajeev's present age = 10 years. 
  
Ex. 2. The ages of two persons differ by 16 years. If 6 years ago, the elder  one be  
3 times as old as the younger one, find their present ages.                   (A.A.O. Exam,2003) 
 Sol. Let the age of the younger person be x years. 
 Then, age of the elder person = (x + 16) years. 
 :. 3 (x - 6) = (x + 16 - 6) ? 3x -18 = x + 10 ? 2x = 28? x = 14. 
 Hence, their present ages are 14 years and 30 years. 
 
Ex. 3. The product of the ages of Ankit and Nikita is 240. If twice the age of Nikita 
is more than Ankit's age by 4 years, what is Nikita's age?  (S.B.I.P.O,1999) 
Sol. Let Ankit's age be x years. Then, Nikita's age = 240/xyears. 
? 2 ? (240 /x ) – x = 4 ? 480 – x2
 = 4x ? x
2
 + 4x – 480 = 0 
                                      ? ( x+24)(x-20) = 0 ? x = 20.   
 Hence, Nikita's age = (22_0) years = 12 years. 1 
Ex. 4. The present age of a father is 3 years more than three times the age of his son. Three years 
hence, father's age will be 10 years more than twice the age of the son. Find the present age of the 
father. . (S.S.C, 2003) 
 Sol. Let the son's present age be x years. Then, father's present age = (3x + 3) years 
 ? (3x + 3 + 3) = 2 (x + 3) + 10 ?  3x + 6 = 2x + 16 ? x = 10. 
 Hence, father's present age = (3x + 3) = ((3 ? 10) + 3) years = 33 years. 
  
Ex. 5. Rohit was 4 times as old as his son 8 years ago. After 8 years, Rohit will be 
twice as old as his son. What are their present ages? 
 Sol. Let son's age 8 years ago be x years. Then, Rohit's age 8 years ago = 4x years. 
 Son's age after 8 years = (x + 8) + 8 = (x + 16) years. 
 Rohit's age after 8 years = (4x + 8) + 8 = (4x+ 16) years. 
 ? 2 (x + 16) = 4x + 16 ? 2x = 16 ? x = 8. 
 Hence, son's 'present age = (x + 8) = 16 years. 
 Rohit's present age = (4x + 8) = 40 years. 
  
 
 
 
Ex. 6. One year ago, the ratio of Gaurav’s and Sachin’s age was 6: 7 respectively. 
Four years hence, this ratio would become 7: 8. How old is Sa chin ? 
 (NABARD, 2002) 
 
 
Sol: 
. Let Gaurav's and Sachin's ages one year ago be 6x and 7x years respectively. Then, Gaurav's age  
  4 years hence = (6x + 1) + 4 = (6x + 5) years. 
Sachin's age 4 years hence = (7x + 1) + 4 = (7x + 5) years. 
 
6x+5  = 7  ? 8(6x+5) = 7 (7x + 5)  ? 48x + 40 = 49x + 35  ? x = 5. 
7x+5     8 
 Hence, Sachin's present age = (7x + 1) = 36 years. 
 
 
,7. Abhay’s age after six years will be three-seventh of his fathers age. Ten years ago the ratio of 
their ages was 1 : 5. What is Abhay’s father's age at present? 
  
Sol. Let the ages of Abhay and his father 10 years ago be x and 5x years respectively. Then, 
 Abhay's age after 6 years = (x + 10) + 6 = (x + 16) years. 
 Father's age after 6 years = (5x + 10) + 6 = (5x + 16) years. 
  
\x + 16) =  3 (5x + 16)  ? 7 (x + 16) = 3 (5x + 16)  ? 7x + 112 = 15x + 48 
                  7               
                                     ?  8x = 64   ?  x = 8. 
Hence, Abhay's father's present age = (5x + 10) = 50 years.

Ex. 13. Which is larger ?2 or 
3?3 ? 
 
Sol. Given surds are of order 2 and 3. Their L.C.M. is 6. Changing each to a surd of order 6, we 
get: 
  ?2 = 21/2 = 2((1/2)*(3/2)) =23/6 =  81/6 = 6?8 
 3?3= 31/3 = 3((1/3)*(2/2)) = 32/6 = (32)1/6 = (9)1/6 = 6?9. 
Clearly, 6?9 > 6?8 and hence 3?3  > ?2. 
 
Ex. 14. Find the largest from among 4?6, ?2 and 3?4. 
Sol. Given surds are of order 4, 2 and 3 respectively. Their L.C,M, is 12, Changing each to a surd 
of order 12, we get: 
 
4?6 = 61/4
 = 6
((1/4)*(3/3))
 = 6

1/12  = (64)1/12. 
3?4 = 41/3 = 4((1/3)*(4/4))  =  44/12  = (44)1/12 = (256)1/12. 
 
Clearly, (256)1/12  >  (216)1/12  >  (64)1/12 
 
Largest one is (256)1/12.  i.e. 3?4 .

10.PERCENTAGE 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
1. Concept of Percentage : By a certain percent ,we mean that many hundredths. Thus 
x percent means x hundredths, written as x%. 
 
To express x% as a fraction : We have , x% = x/100. 
 
Thus, 20% =20/100 =1/5; 48% =48/100 =12/25, etc. 
 
To express a/b as a percent : We have, a/b =((a/b)*100)%. 
 
Thus, ¼ =[(1/4)*100] = 25%; 0.6 =6/10 =3/5 =[(3/5)*100]% =60%. 
 
              
2. If the price of a commodity increases by R%, then the reduction in consumption so 
asnot to increase the expenditure is 
[R/(100+R))*100]%. 
If the price of the commodity decreases by R%,then the increase in consumption so as 
to decrease the      expenditure is  
   [(R/(100-R)*100]%. 
 
3.    Results on Population : Let the population of the town be P now and suppose it 
increases at the rate of     
       R% per annum, then :  
 
1. Population after nyeras = P [1+(R/100)]^n. 
2. Population n years ago = P /[1+(R/100)]^n. 
 
4.    Results on Depreciation :  Let the present value of a machine be P. Suppose  it 
depreciates  at the rate  
       R% per annum. Then, 
      
1. Value of the machine after n years = P[1-(R/100)]
n
. 
2. Value of the machine n years ago = P/[1-(R/100)]
n
. 
 
5. If A is R% more than B, then B is less than A by 
 
   [(R/(100+R))*100]%. 
      
        If  A is R% less than B , then B is more than A by 
 
   [(R/(100-R))*100]%.

(i) ?% of 25 = 20125 (ii) 9% of ? = 63  (iii) 0.25% of ? = 0.04 
 
Sol.   
 
(i) Let x% of 25 = 2.125. Then , (x/100)*25 = 2.125 
                    X = (2.125 * 4) = 8.5. 
 
(ii) Let 9% of x =6.3. Then , 9*x/100 = 6.3 
        X = [(6.3*100)/9] =70. 
 
(iii) Let 0.25% of x = 0.04. Then , 0.25*x/100 = 0.04 
      X= [(0.04*100)/0.25] = 16.   
   
 
Ex. 7.

Sol. 16 (2/3)% =[ (50/3)* )1/100)] = 1/6 = 0.166, 2/15 = 0.133. Clearly, 0.17 is the 
greatest. 
 
Ex. 8. 
If the sales tax  reduced from  3 1/2 % to  3 1/3%, then what difference does it make 
to a person who purchases an article with market price of Rs. 8400 ? 
 
Sol.   Required difference = [3 ½ % of Rs.8400] – [3 1/3 % of Rs.8400] 
                                          = [(7/20-(10/3)]% of Rs.8400 =1/6 % of Rs.8400 
               = Rs. [(1/6)8(1/100)*8400] =  Rs. 14. 
 
Ex. 9. An inspector rejects 0.08% of the meters as defective. How many will be 
examine to project ? 
 
Sol.  Let the number of meters to be examined be x. 
Then, 0.08% of x =2 
[(8/100)*(1/100)*x] = 2 
x = [(2*100*100)/8] = 2500.   
 
Ex. 10. Sixty five percent of a number is 21 less than four fifth of that number. What 
is the number ? 
 
Sol.  Let the number be x. 
Then, 4*x/5 –(65% of x) = 21 
4x/5 –65x/100 = 21 
5 x = 2100 
x = 140. 
 
Ex.11. Difference of two numbers is 1660. If 7.5% of the number is 12.5% of the 
other number , find the number ? 
Sol.  Let the numbers be x and y. Then , 7.5 % of x =12.5% of y 
X = 125*y/75 = 5*y/3. 
Now, x-y =1660  
5*y/3 –y =1660 
2*y/3= 1660 
y =[ (1660*3)/2] =2490. 
One number = 2490, Second number =5*y/3 =4150. 
 
Ex. 12. 
In expressing a length 810472 km as nearly as possible with three significant digits , 
find the percentage error. 
Sol.  Error = (81.5 – 81.472)km = 0.028. 
  Required percentage = [(0.028/81.472)*100]% = 0.034%. 
 
Ex. 13.  
In an election between two candidates, 75% of the voters cast thier thier votes, out 
of which 2% of the votes were declared invalid. A candidate got 9261 votes which 
were 75% of the total valid votes. Find the total number of votes enrolled in that 
election. 
Sol. 
 Let the number of votes enrolled be x. Then , 
Number of votes cast =75% of x. Valid votes = 98% of (75% of x). 
75% of  (98% of (75%of x)) =9261. 
[(75/100)*(98/100)*(75/100)*x] =9261. 
X = [(9261*100*100*100)/(75*98*75)] =16800. 
 
Ex.14. Shobha’s mathematics test had 75 problems i.e.10 arithmetic, 30 algebra and 
35 geometry problems. Although she answered 70% of the arithmetic ,40% of the 
algebra, and 60% of the geometry problems correctly.  she did not pass the test 
because she got less than  60% of the problems right. How many more questions she 
would have to answer correctly to earn 60% of the passing grade? 
          
Sol. Number  of questions attempted correctly=(70% of 10 + 40% of 30 + 60% 0f 35) 
                                                                          =7 + 12+21= 45 
questions to be answered correctly for 60% grade=60% of 75 = 45 
 
therefore required number of questions= (45-40) = 5. 
 
Ex.15. if 50% of (x-y) = 30% of (x+y) then what percent of x is y? 
 
Sol.50% of (x-y)=30% of(x+y) ? (50/100)(x-y)=(30/100)(x+y) 
        ?5(x-y)=3(x+y) ? 2x=8y ? x=4y 
              therefore required percentage =((y/x) X 100)% = ((y/4y) X 100) =25% 
 
Ex.16. Mr.Jones gave 40% of the money he had to his wife. he also gave 20% of the 
remaining amount to his 3 sons. half of the amount now left was spent on 
miscellaneous items and the remaining amount of Rs.12000 was deposited in the 
bank. how much money did Mr.jones have initially?  
  
Sol. Let the initial amount with Mr.jones be Rs.x then, 
       Money given to wife= Rs.(40/100)x=Rs.2x/5.Balance=Rs(x-(2x/5)=Rs.3x/5. 
       Money given to 3 sons= Rs(3X((20/200) X (3x/5)) = Rs.9x/5. 
       Balance = Rs.((3x/5) – (9x/25))=Rs.6x/25. 
      Amount deposited in bank= Rs(1/2 X 6x/25)=Rs.3x/25. 
 
      Therefore 3x/25=12000 ? x= ((12000 x 35)/3)=100000 
        
      So Mr.Jones initially had Rs.1,00,000 with him. 
 
Short-cut Method : Let the initial amount with Mr.Jones be Rs.x 
Then,(1/2)[100-(3*20)]% of x=12000 
 
? (1/2)*(40/100)*(60/100)*x=12000 
?x=((12000*25)/3)=100000 
 
Ex 17 10% of the inhabitants of village having died of cholera.,a panic set in , during 
which 25% of the remaining inhabitants left the village. The population is then 
reduced to 4050. Find the number of original inhabitants. 
Sol: 
Let the total number of orginal inhabitants be x. 
((75/100))*(90/100)*x)=4050 ? (27/40)*x=4050 
 
?x=((4050*40)/27)=6000. 
 
Ex.18 A salesman`s commission is 5% on all sales upto Rs.10,000 and 4% on all 
sales exceeding this.He remits Rs.31,100 to his parent company after deducing his 
commission . Find the total sales. 
Sol: 
Let his total sales be Rs.x.Now(Total sales) – (Commission )=Rs.31,100 
  x-[(5% of 10000 + 4% of (x-10000)]=31,100 
x-[((5/100)*10000 + (4/100)*(x-10000)]=31,100 
?x-500-((x-10000)/25)=31,100 
?x-(x/25)=31200 ? 24x/25=31200?x=[(31200*25)/24)=32,500. 
Total sales=Rs.32,500 
 
Ex .19 Raman`s salary was decreased by 50% and subsequently increased by 
50%.How much percent does he lose? 
Sol: 
Let the original salary = Rs.100 
New final salary=150% of  (50% of Rs.100)= 
Rs.((150/100)*(50/100)*100)=Rs.75. 
Decrease = 25% 
 
Ex.20 Paulson spends 75% of his income. His income is increased by 20% and he 
increased his expenditure by 10%.Find the percentage increase in his savings . 
Sol: 
Let the original income=Rs.100 . Then , expenditure=Rs.75 and savings =Rs.25 
New income =Rs.120 , New expenditure = 
Rs.((110/100)*75)=Rs.165/2 
New savings = Rs.(120-(165/2)) =  Rs.75/2 
Increase in savings = Rs.((75/2)-25)=Rs.25/2 
Increase %= ((25/2)*(1/25)*100)% = 50%. 
 
Ex21. The salary of a person was reduced by 10% .By what percent should his 
reduced salary be raised so as to bring it at par with his original salary ? 
Sol: 
Let the original salary be Rs.100 . New salary = Rs.90. 
Increase on 90=10 , Increase on 100=((10/90)*100)% 
= (100/9)% 
 
Ex.22 When the price fo a product was decreased by 10% , the number sold 
increased by 30%. What was the effect on the total revenue ? 
Sol: 
Let the price of the product be Rs.100 and let original sale be 100 pieces. 
Then , Total Revenue = Rs.(100*100)=Rs.10000. 
New revenue = Rs.(90*130)=Rs.11700. 
Increase in revenue = ((1700/10000)*100)%=17%. 
 
Ex 23 . If the numerator of a fraction be increased by 15% and its denominator be 
diminished by 8% , the value of the fraction is 15/16. Find the original fraction. 
Sol: 
Let the original fraction be x/y. 
Then (115%of x)/(92% of y)=15/16 => (115x/92y)=15/16 
? ((15/16)*(92/115))=3/4 
 
Ex.24 In the new budget , the price of kerosene oil rose by 25%. By how much 
percent must a person reduce his consumption so that his expenditure  on it does not 
increase ? 
Sol: 
Reduction  in consumption = [((R/(100+R))*100]% 
? [(25/125)*100]%=20%. 
 
Ex.25 The population of a town is 1,76,400 . If it increases at the rate of 5% per 
annum , what will be its population 2 years hence ? What was it 2 years ago ? 
Sol: 
Population after 2 years = 176400*[1+(5/100)]^2 
=[176400*(21/20)*(21/40)] 
= 194481. 
Population 2 years ago = 176400/[1+(5/100)]^2 
=[716400*(20/21)*(20/21)]= 160000. 
 
Ex.26 The value of a machine depreiates at the rate of 10% per annum. If its present 
is Rs.1,62,000 what will be its worth after 2 years ? What was the value of the 
machine 2 years ago ? 
Sol. 
Value of the machine after 2 years  
=Rs.[162000*(1-(10/100))^2] = Rs.[162000*(9/10)*(9/10)] 
=Rs. 131220 
Value of the machine 2 years ago  
= Rs.[162000/(1-(10/100)^2)]=Rs.[162000*(10/9)*(10/9)]=Rs.200000 
 
Ex27. During one year, the population of town increased by 5% . If the total 
population is 9975 at the end of the second year , then what was the population size 
in the beginning of the first year ? 
Sol: 
Population in the beginning of the first year 
= 9975/[1+(5/100)]*[1-(5/100)] = [9975*(20/21)*(20/19)]=10000. 
 
Ex.28 If A earns 99/3% more than B,how much percent does B earn less then A ? 
Sol: 
Required Percentage = [((100/3)*100)/[100+(100/3)]]% 
=[(100/400)*100]%=25% 
 
Ex. 29 If  A`s salary is 20% less then B`s salary , by how much percent is B`s salary 
more than A`s ? 
Sol: 
Required percentage = [(20*100)/(100-20)]%=25%. 
 
 
 
 
Ex30 .How many kg of pure salt must be added to 30kg of 2% solution of salt and 
water to increase it to 10% solution ? 
Sol: 
Amount of salt in 30kg solution = [(20/100)*30]kg=0.6kg 
Let x kg of pure salt be added  
Then , (0.6+x)/(30+x)=10/100?60+100x=300+10x 
?90x=240 ? x=8/3. 
 
Ex 31. Due to reduction of 25/4% in the price of sugar , a man is able to buy 1kg 
more for Rs.120. Find the original and reduced rate of sugar. 
Sol: 
Let the original rate be Rs.x per kg. 
Reduced rate = Rs.[(100-(25/4))*(1/100)*x}]=Rs.15x/16per kg 
120/(15x/16)-(120/x)=1 ? (128/x)-(120/x)=1 
? x=8. 
So, the original rate = Rs.8 per kg 
Reduce rate = Rs.[(15/16)*8]per kg =  Rs.7.50 per kg 
 
Ex.32 In an examination , 35% of total students failed in Hindi , 45% failed in 
English and 20% in both . Find the percentage of those who passed in both subjects 
. 
Sol: 
Let A and B be the sets of students who failed in Hindi and English respectively .  
Then , n(A) = 35 , n(B)=45 , n(A?B)=20. 
So , n(A?B)=n(A)+n(B)- n(A?B)=35+45-20=60. 
Percentage failed in Hindi and English or both=60% 
Hence , percentage passed = (100-60)%=40% 
 
Ex33. In an examination , 80% of the students passed in English , 85% in 
Mathematics and 75% in both English and Mathematics. If 40 students failed in 
both the subjects , find the total number of students. 
Sol: 
Let the total number of students be x . 
Let A and B represent the sets of students who passed in English and Mathematics 
respectively .  
Then , number of students passed in one or both the subjects  
= n(A?B)=n(A)+n(B)- n(A?B)=80% of x + 85% of x –75% of x 
=[(80/100)x+(85/100)x-(75/100)x]=(90/100)x=(9/10)x 
Students who failed in both the subjects = [x-(9x/10)]=x/10. 
So, x/10=40 of x=400 . 
Hence ,total number of students = 400.

12. RATIO AND PROPORTION 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
     I. RATIO: The ratio of two quantities a and b in the same units, is the fraction a/b and we write it as a:b.  
In the ratio a:b, we call a as the first term or antecedent and b, the second  term or consequent. 
 
Ex. The ratio 5: 9 represents 5/9 with antecedent = 5, consequent = 9. 
Rule: The multiplication or division of each term of a ratio by the same non-zero number does not 
affect the ratio. 
Ex.  4: 5 = 8: 10 = 12: 15 etc. Also, 4: 6 = 2: 3. 
 
    2. PROPORTION: The equality of two ratios is called proportion. 
If a: b = c: d, we write, a: b:: c : d and we say that a, b, c, d are in proportion . Here a and d are called 
extremes, while b and c are called mean terms. 
 Product of means = Product of extremes. 
Thus, a: b:: c : d <=> (b x c) = (a x d). 
 
3. (i) Fourth Proportional: If a : b = c: d, then d is called the fourth proportional 
 to a, b, c. 
   (ii) Third Proportional: If a: b = b: c, then c is called the third proportional to 
 a and b. 
   (iii) Mean Proportional: Mean proportional between a and b is square root of ab 
 
4. (i) COMPARISON OF RATIOS: 
        We say that (a: b) > (c: d) <=>  (a/b)>(c /d). 
 (ii) COMPOUNDED RATIO: 
 The compounded ratio of the ratios (a: b), (c: d), (e : f) is (ace: bdf) 
 
5. (i) Duplicate ratio of (a : b) is (a
2
 : b
2
). 
      (ii) Sub-duplicate ratio of (a : b) is (?a : ?b). 
     (iii)Triplicate ratio of (a : b) is (
a3
 : 
b3
). 
     (iv) Sub-triplicate ratio of (a : b) is (a ? : b ? ). 
     (v) If (a/b)=(c/d), then  ((a+b)/(a-b))=((c+d)/(c-d))    (Componendo and dividendo) 
 
6. VARIATION: 
(i) We say that x is directly proportional to y, if x = ky  for some constant k and 
     we write, x ? y. 
(ii) We say that x is inversely proportional to y, if xy = k for some constant k and  
       we write, x?(1/y)

Sol. 
  
i) Let the fourth proportional to 4, 9, 12 be x. 
 
       Then, 4 : 9 : : 12 : x  ?4 x x=9x12 ? X=(9 x 12)/14=27; 
   Fourth proportional to 4, 9, 12 is 27. 
 
 (ii) Let the third proportional to 16 and 36 be x. 
 
      Then, 16 : 36 : : 36 : x  ?16 x x = 36 x 36 ? x=(36 x 36)/16 =81 
      Third proportional to 16 and 36 is 81. 
  
 
(iii) Mean proportional between 0.08 and 0.18

    4x/(3x+5)=4/5 ?20x=4(3x+5)?8x=20 ?x=2.5 
       Quantity of alcohol = (4 x 2.5) litres = 10 litres. 
 
 
13. PARTNERSHIP 
!IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE I 
 1. Partnership: When two or more than two persons run a business jointly, they are 
    called partners and the deal is known as partnership. 
 
2. Ratio of Division of Gains: 
          i) When investments of all the partners are for the same time, the gain or loss is 
distributed     a  among the partners in the ratio of their investments. 
Suppose A and B invest Rs. x and Rs. y respectively for a year in a business, then at the 
end of the year: 
(A’s share of profit) : (B's share of profit) = x : y. 
       ii) When investments are for different time periods, then equivalent capitals are 
calculated for a    unit of time by taking (capital x number of units of time). Now, gain or 
loss is divided in the ratio of  these capitals. 
 
Suppose A invests Rs. x for p months and B invests Rs. y for q months, then  
 (A’s share of profit) : (B's share of profit) = xp : yq. 
 
3. Working and Sleeping Partners: A partner who manages the business is known . as a 
working partner and the one who simply invests the money is a sleeping partner. 
 
 SOLVED EXAMPLES  
 
Ex. 1. A, B and C started a business by investing Rs. 1,20,000, Rs. 1,35,000 and 
,Rs.1,50,000 respectively. Find the share of each, out of an annual profit of Rs. 
56,700.  
 
Sol. Ratio of shares of A, Band C = Ratio of their investments 
= 120000 : 135000 : 150000 = 8 : 9 : 10. 
A’s share = Rs. (56700 x (8/27))= Rs. 16800. 
B's share = Rs. ( 56700 x (9/27)) = Rs. 18900. 
C's share = Rs. ( 56700 x (10/27))=Rs. 21000. 
 
Ex. 2. Alfred started a business investing Rs. 45,000. After 3 months, Peter joined 
him with a capital of Rs. 60,000. After another 6 months, Ronald joined them with a 
capital of Rs. 90,000. At the end of the year, they made a profit of Rs. 16,500. Find 
the lire of each. 
 
 Sol. Clearly, Alfred invested his capital for 12 months, Peter for 9 months and Ronald 
 for 3 months. 
         So, ratio of their capitals = (45000 x 12) : (60000 x 9) : (90000 x 3) 
 = 540000 : 540000 : 270000 = 2 : 2 : 1. 
 Alfred's share = Rs. (16500 x (2/5)) = Rs. 6600 
         Peter's share = Rs. (16500 x (2/5)) = Rs. 6600 
         Ronald's share = Rs. (16500 x (1/5)) = Rs. 3300. 
Ex. 3. A, Band C start a business each investing Rs. 20,000. After 5 months A  
withdrew Rs.6000  B withdrew Rs. 4000 and C invests Rs. 6000 more. At the end of 
the year, a total profit of Rs. 69,900 was recorded. Find the share of each. 
 
Sol. Ratio of the capitals of A, Band C 
                     = 20000 x 5 + 15000 x 7 : 20000 x 5 + 16000 x 7 : 20000 x 5 + 26000 x 7  
                      = 205000:212000 : 282000 = 205 : 212 : 282. 
 
  
 A’s share = Rs. 69900 x (205/699) = Rs. 20500 I 
  
        B's share = Rs. 69900 x (212/699) = Rs. 21200;  
 
        C's share = Rs. 69900 x (282/699) = Rs. 28200. 
  
Ex. 4. A, Band C enter into partnership. A invests 3 times as much as B 
and B invests two-third of what C invests. At the end of the year, the profit earned is 
Rs. 6600. What is the share of B ? 
Sol. Let C's capital = Rs. x. Then, B's capital = Rs. (2/3)x 
        A’s capital = Rs. (3 x (2/3).x) = Rs. 2x. 
      Ratio of their capitals = 2x : (2/3)x :x = 6 : 2 : 3. 
 
     Hence, B's share = Rs. ( 6600 x (2/11))= Rs. 1200. 
Ex. 5. Four milkmen rented a pasture. A grazed 24 cows for 3 months; B 10 for  5 
months; C 35 cows for 4 months and D 21 cows for 3 months. If A's share of rent is Rs. 
720, find the total rent of the field. 
 
Sol. Ratio of shares of A, B, C, D = (24 x 3) : (10 x 5) : (35 x 4) : (21 x 3)  = 72 : 50 : 140 
: 63. 
  
 Let total rent be Rs. x. Then, A’s share = Rs. (72x)/325 
                      (72x)/325=720 ? x=(720 x 325)/72 = 3250  
  
              Hence, total rent of the field is Rs. 3250. 
  
Ex.6. A invested Rs. 76,000 in a business. After few months, B joined him Rs. 
57,000. At the end of the year, the total profit was divided between them in ratio  2 : 
1. After bow many months did B join? 
 
Sol. Suppose B joined after x months. Then, B's money was invested for (12 - x) 
 (76000 x 12)/(57000 x (12-x) =2/1 ? 912000=114000(12-x) 
   
 114 (12 - x) = 912?12-x=8?x=4 
 
 Hence, B joined after 4 months. 
 
 
Ex.7. A, Band C enter into a partnership by investing in the ratio of 3 : 2: 4. After 1 
year, B invests another Rs. 2,70,000 and C, at the end of 2 years, also invests 
Rs.2,70,000. At the end of three years, profits are shared in the ratio of 3 : 4 : 5. Find 
initial investment of each. 
 
Sol. Let the initial investments of A, Band C be Rs. 3x, Rs. 2x and Rs. 4x respectively. 
Then, 
(3x x 36) : [(2x x 12) + (2x + 270000) x 24] : [(4x x 24) + (4x +270000) x 12]=3:4:5 
  
1O8x : (72x + 6480000) : (144x + 3240000) = 3 : 4 : 5 
 108x /(72x+6480000)=3/4  ? 432x = 216x + 19440000 
 ?216x = 19440000  
                                       x=90000 
 
  
Hence, A’s initial investment = 3x = Rs. 2,70,000; 
   B's initial investment = 2x = Rs. 1,80,000; 
 C's initial investment = 4x = Rs. 3,60,000. 
 
 
 
  
 
14. CHAIN RULE 
_IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE  
 
1. Direct Proportion: Two quantities are said to be directly proportional, if on the increase (or decrease) 
of the one, the other increases (or decreases) to the same 
 Ex. 1. Cost is directly proportional to the number of articles. 
 (More Articles, More Cost) 
 
Ex. 2. Work done is directly proportional to the number of men working on it 
 (More Men, More Work) 
   2. Indirect Proportion: Two quantities are said to be indirectly proportional,if on the increase of the one, 
the other decreases to the same extent and vice-versa.  
    Ex. 1. The time taken by a car in covering a certain distance is inversely proportional to the speed of the 
car. 
              (More speed, Less is the time taken to cover a distance) 
 
Ex. 2. Time taken to finish a work is inversely proportional to the num of persons working at it. 
(More persons, Less is the time taken to finish a job) 
 
Remark: In solving questions by chain rule, we compare every item with the term to be found out. 
 
 
 SOL VED EXAMPLES  
 
Ex. 1. If 15 toys cost Rs, 234, what do 35 toys cost? 
 Sol. Let the required cost be Rs. x. Then, 
 More toys, More cost (Direct Proportion) 
. 15 : 35 : : 234 : x ? (15 x x) = (35 x 234) ? x=(35 X 234)/15 =546 
 Hence, the cost of 35 toys is Rs. 546. 
Ex. 2. If 36 men can do a piece of work in 25 hours, in how many hours will 15 men 
do it ? 
Sol. Let the required number of hours be x. Then, 
        Less men, More hours (Indirect Proportion) 
  
       15 : 36 : : 25 : x ?(15 x x) = (36 x 25) ?(36 x 25)/15 = 60 
         
       Hence, 15 men can do it in 60 hours. 
 
Ex. 3. If the wages of 6 men for 15 days be Rs.2100, then find the wages of 
for 12 days. 
 
Sol. Let the required wages be Rs. x. 
 More men, More wages (Direct Proportion) 
 Less days, Less wages (Direct Proportion) 
 
Men  6: 9           : :2100:x 
Days 15:12 
Therefore (6 x 15 x x)=(9 x 12 x 2100) ? x=(9 x 12 x 2100)/(6 x 15)=2520 
 
    Hence the required wages are Rs. 2520. 
 
 
Ex. 4. If 20 men can build a wall 66 metres long in 6 days, what length of a similar can be built by 86 
men in 8 days? 
 
Sol. Let the required length be x metres 
 
More men, More length built     (Direct Proportion)                                            
  
Less days, Less length built      (Direct Proportion) 
 
  
Men 20: 35 
Days 6: 3  : : 56 : x 
 
Therefore (20 x 6 x x)=(35 x 3 x 56)?x=(35 x 3 x 56)/120=49 
 
         Hence, the required length is 49 m. 
 
 
  
Ex. 5. If 15 men, working 9 hours a day, can reap a field in 16 days, in how many 
days will 18 men reap the field, working 8 hours a day? 
      
     Sol. Let the required number of days be x. 
More men, Less days   (indirect proportion) 
Less hours per day, More days (indirect proportion) 
 
 
 Men 18 : 15 
       Hours per day 8: 9   } : :16 : x 
        (18 x 8 x x)=(15 x 9 x 16)? x=(44 x 15)144 = 15 
      
 Hence, required number of days = 15. 
 
 
Ex. 6. If 9 engines consume 24 metric tonnes of coal, when each is working 8 hours 
day, bow much coal will be required for 8 engines, each running 13hours a day, it being given that 3 
engines of former type consume as much as 4 engines of latter type? 
  
Sol. Let 3 engines of former type consume 1 unit in 1 hour. 
 Then, 4 engines of latter type consume 1 unit in 1 hour. 
Therefore 1 engine of former type consumes(1/3) unit in 1 hour. 
 
1 engine of latter type consumes(1/4) unit in 1 hour. 
 
Let the required consumption of coal be x units. 
Less engines, Less coal consumed  (direct proportion) 
More working hours, More coal consumed (direct proportion) 
Less rate of consumption, Less coal consumed(direct prportion) 
 
 Number of engines 9: 8 
Working hours 8 : 13 } :: 24 : x 
Rate of consumption (1/3):(1/4) 
 [ 9 x 8 x (1/3) x  x) = (8 x 13 x (1/4) x 24 ) ? 24x = 624 ? x = 26. 
Hence, the required consumption of coal = 26 metric tonnes. 
 
Ex. 7. A contract is to be completsd in 46 days sad 117 men were said to work 8 hours a day.   After 
33 days, (4/7) of the work is completed. How many additional men may be employed so that the 
work may be completed in time, each man now working 9 hours a day? 
        Sol. Remaining work = (1-(4/7) =(3/7)  
                Remaining period = (46 - 33) days = 13days 
       Let the total men working at it be x. 
 Less work, Less men (Direct Proportion) 
 Less days, More men (Indirect Proportion) 
 More Hours per Day, Less men (Indirect Proportion) 
 
Work  (4/7): (3/7) 
Days  13:33         } : : 117: x 
Hrs/day 9 : 8 
Therefore (4/7) x 13 x 9 x x =(3/7) x 33 x 8 x 117 or x=(3 x 33 x 8 x 117)/(4 x 13 x 9)=198 
 
  Additional men to be employed = (198 - 117) = 81. 
 
 
Ex. 8. A garrison of 3300 men had provisions for 32 days, when given at the rate of 860 gns per head. 
At the end of 7 days, a reinforcement arrives and it was for that the provisions wi1l last 17 days 
more, when given at the rate of 826 gms per head, What is the strength of the reinforcement? 
 
Sol. The problem becomes: 
   3300 men taking 850 gms per head have provisions for (32 - 7) or 25 days,  
How many men taking 825 gms each have provisions for 17 days?  
 Less ration per head, more men (Indirect Proportion) 
 Less days, More men (Indirect Proportion) 
                
 Ration 825 : 850 
 Days 17: 25  } : : 3300 : x 
(825 x 17 x x) = 850 x 25 x 3300 or x = (850 x 25 x 3300)/(825 x 17)=5000 
Strength of reinforcement = (5500 - 3300) = 1700. 
 
 
15. TIME AND WORK 
IIMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
1. If A can do a piece of work in n days, then A's 1 day's work = (1/n). 
  
2. If A’s 1 day's work = (1/n),then A can finish the work in n days. 
 
    3.  A is thrice as good a workman as B, then: 
          Ratio of work done by A and B = 3 : 1. 
          Ratio of times taken by A and B to finish a work = 1 : 3. 
 
SOLVED EXAMPLES 
 
Ex. 1. Worker A takes 8 hours to do a job. Worker B takes 10 hours to do the same Job.How 
long should it take both A and B, working together but independently, to do                 the 
same job? (IGNOU, 2003) 
 Sol. A’s 1 hour's work = 1/8 
           B's 1 hour's work = 1/10 
  
          (A + B)'s 1 hour's work = (1/8) +(1/10)=9/40 
Both A and B will finish the work in 40/9 days. 
  
Ex. 2. A and B together can complete a piece of work in 4 days. If A alone can complete the 
same work in 12 days, in how many days can B alone complete that work?  (Bank P.O. 
2003) 
 
Sol. (A + B)'s 1 day's work = (1/4). A's 1 day's work = (1/12). 
  
       B's 1 day's work =((1/4)-(1/12))=(1/6) 
         
     Hence, B alone can complete the work in 6 days. 
 
 
Ex. 3. A can do a piece of work in 7 days of 9 hours each and B can do it in 6 days 
of 7 bours each. How long will they take to do it, working together 8 hours a day? 
  
Sol. A can complete the work in (7 x 9) = 63 hours. 
 B can complete the work in (6 x 7) = 42 hours. 
        A’s 1 hour's work = (1/63) and B's 1 hour's work =(1/42) 
         
        (A + B)'s 1 hour's work =(1/63)+(1/42)=(5/126) 
      Both will finish the work in (126/5) hrs. 
Number of days. of (42/5) hrs each =(126 x 5)/(5 x 42)=3 days 
 
Ex. 4. A and B can do a piece of work in 18 days; Band C can do it in 24 days A and C can do 
it in 36 days. In how many days will A, Band C finish it together and separately? 
 
  
Sol. (A + B)'s 1 day's work = (1/18)    (B + C)'s 1 day's work = (1/24) 
 and (A + C)'s 1 day's work = (1/36) 
 
  
       Adding, we get:  2 (A + B + C)'s 1 day's work =(1/18 + 1/24 + 1/36) 
                                     =9/72 =1/8 
 
      (A +B + C)'s 1 day's work =1/16  
 
      Thus, A, Band C together can finish the work in 16 days. 
      Now, A’s 1 day's work = [(A + B + C)'s 1 day's work] - [(B + C)'s 1 day work: 
                                     =(1/16 – 1/24)= 1/48 
 
A alone can finish the work in 48 days. 
Similarly, B's 1 day's work =(1/16 – 1/36)=5/144 
B alone can finish the work in  144/5=28 4/5 days 
And C’s 1 day work =(1/16-1/18)=1/144 
Hence C alone can finish the work in 144 days. 
 
Ex. 6. A is twice as good a workman as B and together they finish a piece 
in 18 days. In how many days will A alone finish the work? 
 Sol. (A’s 1 day’s work):)(B’s 1 days work) = 2 : 1. 
  
(A + B)'s 1 day's work = 1/18 
 
Divide 1/18 in the ratio 2 : 1. 
 :. A’s 1 day's work =(1/18*2/3)=1/27 
 
         Hence, A alone can finish the work in 27 days. 
 
Ex. 6. A can do a certain job in 12 days. B is 60% more efficient than A. How many 
days does B alone take to do the same job? 
 Sol. Ratio of times taken by A and B = 160 : 100 = 8 : 5. 
 Suppose B alone takes x days to do the job. 
      Then, 8 : 5 :: 12 : x = 8x = 5 x 12 =x = 7 1/2 days. 
  
Ex. 7. A can do a piece of work in 80 days. He works at it for 10 days B alone finishes the 
remaining work in 42 days. In how much time will A and B working together, finish the 
work? 
Sol. Work done by A in 10 days =(1/80*10)=1/8  
Remaining work = (1- 1/8) =7/ 8 
Now,7/ 8 work is done by B in 42 days. 
 Whole work will be done by B in (42 x 8/7) = 48 days. 
A’s 1 day's work = 1/80 and B's 1 day's work = 1/48 
  
(A+B)'s 1 day's work = (1/80+1/48)=8/240=1/30 
Hence, both will finish the work in 30 days. 
 
Ex. 8. A and B undertake to do a piece of work for Rs. 600. A alone can do it in 6 days while B 
alone can do it in 8 days. With the help of C, they finish it in 3 days. !find the share of each. 
  
Sol :C's 1 day's work = 1/3-(1/6+1/8)=24 
 A : B : C = Ratio of their 1 day's work = 1/6:1/8:1/24= 4 : 3 : 1. 
   A’s share = Rs. (600 *4/8) = Rs.300, B's share = Rs. (600 *3/8) = Rs. 225. 
  C's share = Rs. [600 - (300 + 225») = Rs. 75. 
 
Ex.  9. A and B working separately can do a piece of work in 9 and 12 days respectively, If 
they work for a day alternately, A beginning, in how many days, the work will be completed? 
 (A + B)'s 2 days' work =(1/9+1/12)=7/36 
Work done in 5 pairs of days =(5*7/36)=35/36 
   Remaining work =(1-35/36)=1/36 
 
  On 11th day, it is A’s turn. 1/9 work is done by him in 1 day. 
  
 1/36 work is done by him in(9*1/36)=1/4 day 
Total time taken = (10 + 1/4) days = 10 1/4days. 
Ex 10 .45 men can complete a work in 16 days. Six days after they started working, 30 more 
men joined them. How many days will they now take to complete the remaining work? 
 
(45 x 16) men can complete the work in 1 day. 
  
1 man's 1 day's work = 1/720 
  
45 men's 6 days' work =(1/16*6)=3/8 
 
 Remaining work =(1-3/8)=5/8 
 
75 men's 1 day's work = 75/720=5/48  
 
Now,5 work is done by them in 1 day. 
       48 
  
5work is done  by them in (48 x 5)=6 days. 
8        5     8  
 
 
Ex:11.   2 men and 3 boys can do a piece of work in 10 days while 3 men and 2 boys can do the 
same work in 8 days.In how many days can 2 men and 1 boy do the work? 
Soln: Let 1 man’s 1 day’s work = x and 1 boy’s 1 day’s work = y. 
Then, 2x+3y = 1 and 3x+2y = 1 
10 8 
Solving,we get:  x = 7  and y = 1 
   200        100  
     
(2 men + 1 boy)’s 1 day’s work  = (2 x   7 + 1 x 1  ) = 16 =  2 
        200    100     200   25 
So, 2 men and 1 boy together can finish the work in 25 =12 1     days

16. PIPES AND CISTERNS 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
1. Inlet: A pipe connected with a tank or a cistern or a reservoir, that fills it, is known as an 
inlet. 
Outlet: A pipe connected with a tank or a cistern or a reservoir, emptying it, is 
known as an outlet. 
 
2. (i) If a pipe can fill a tank in x hours, then : part filled in 1 hour = 1/x 
 
(ii) If a pipe can empty a full tank in y hours, then : part emptied in 1 hour = 1/y 
(iii) If a pipe can .fill a tank in x hours and another pipe can empty the full tank in y hours                              
(where y> x), then on opening both the pipes, the net part filled in 1 hour = (1/x)-(1/y) 
      (iv) If a pipe can fill a tank in x hours and another pipe can empty the full tank in y hours (where 
x > y), then on opening both the pipes, the net part emptied in 1 hour = (1/y)-(1/x) 
 
SOLVED EXAMPLES  
 
 Ex. 1:Two pipes A and B can fill a tank in 36 bours and 46 bours respectively. If both  
the pipes are opened simultaneously, bow mucb time will be taken to fill the 
tank? 
 
Sol: Part filled by A in 1 hour = (1/36); 
         Part filled by B in 1 hour = (1/45); 
 
        Part filled by (A + B) In 1 hour =(1/36)+(1/45)=(9/180)=(1/20) 
 
        Hence, both the pipes together will fill the tank in 20 hours. 
 
Ex. 2: Two pipes can fill a tank in 10hours and 12 hours respectively while a 
third, pipe empties the full tank in 20 hours. If all the three pipes operate 
simultaneously, in how much time will the tank be filled? 
 
Sol: Net part filled In 1 hour =(1/10)+(1/12)-(1/20)=(8/60)=(2/15). 
      The tank will be full in 15/2 hrs = 7 hrs 30 min. 
 
Ex. 3: If two pipes function simultaneously, tbe reservoir will be filled in 12 hours. One 
pipe fills the reservoir 10 hours faster than tbe otber. How many hours does it take the 
second pipe to fill the reservoir? 
 
Sol:let the reservoir be filled by first pipe in x hours. 
 
      Then ,second pipe fill it in (x+10)hrs. 
 
      Therefore (1/x)+(1/x+10)=(1/12)   ?(x+10+x)/(x(x+10))=(1/12). 
 
  ? x^2 –14x-120=0  ? (x-20)(x+6)=0 
 
 
   ?x=20                [neglecting the negative value of x] 
 
      so, the second pipe will take (20+10)hrs. (i.e) 30 hours to fill the reservoir 
 
 
Ex. 4: A cistern has two taps which fill it in 12 minutes and 15minutes 
respectively. There is also a waste pipe in the cistern. When all the 3 are opened , 
the empty cistern is full in 20 minutes. How long will the waste pipe take to empty 
the full cistern? 
 
Sol: Workdone by the waste pipe in 1min 
 
       =(1/20)-(1/12)+(1/15) = -1/10   [negative sign means emptying] 
 
       therefore the waste pipe will empty the full cistern in 10min 
 
 
Ex. 5: An electric pump can fill a tank in 3 hours. Because of a leak in ,the tank it took 
3(1/2) hours to fill the tank. If the tank is full, how much time will the leak take  
to empty it ? 
Sol: work done by the leak in 1 hour=(1/3)-(1/(7/2))=(1/3)-(2/7)=(1/21). 
        The leak will empty .the tank in 21 hours. 
 Ex. 6. Two pipes can fill a cistern in 14 hours and 16 hours respectively. The pipes  
are opened simultaneously and it is found that due to leakage in the bottom it tooki 32 
minutes more to fill the cistern.When the cistern is full, in what time  will the leak empty it? 
 
Sol: Work done by the two pipes in 1 hour =(1/14)+(1/16)=(15/112). 
       Time taken by these pipes to fill the tank = (112/15) hrs = 7 hrs 28 min. 
       Due to leakage, time taken = 7 hrs 28 min + 32 min = 8 hrs 
      Work done by (two pipes + leak) in 1 hour = (1/8). 
 
      Work done by the leak m 1 hour =(15/112)-(1/8)=(1/112). 
 
       Leak will empty the full cistern in 112 hours. 
 
 
Ex. 7: Two pipes A and B can fill a tank in 36 min. and 45 min. respectively. A water  
pipe C can empty the tank in 30 min. First A and B are opened. after 7 min,C is also 
opened. In how much time, the tank is full? 
 
Sol:Part filled in 7 min. = 7*((1/36)+(1/45))=(7/20). 
       Remaining part=(1-(7/20))=(13/20). 
      Net part filled in 1min. when A,B and C are opened=(1/36)+(1/45)-(1/30)=(1/60). 
      Now,(1/60) part is filled in one minute. 
     (13/20) part is filled in (60*(13/20))=39 minutes. 
 
     Ex.8: Two pipes A,B can fill a tank in 24 min. and 32 min. respectively. If both the pipes 
are opened simultaneously, after how much time B should be closed so that the tank is full 
in 18 min.? 
 
Sol: let B be closed after x min. then , 
       Part filled by (A+B) in x min. +part filled by  A in (18-x)min.=1 
       Therefore x*((1/24)+(1/32))+(18-x)*(1/24)=1   ? (7x/96) + ((18-x)/24)=1. 
      ? 7x +4*(18-x)=96. 
      Hence, be must be closed after 8 min.

hour and 40 minutes, the distance covered by him was 5 of the remaining distance. 
What was his speed in metres per second? 
             7 
Sol. Let the speed be x km/hr. 
       Then, distance covered in 1 hr. 40 min. i.e., 1  2  hrs  = 5x  km 
3 3   
        Remaining distance = { 24 – 5x } km.

find the distance of the post-office from the village. 
Sol.    Average speed   = { 2xy  } km/hr  ={  2*25*4  } km/hr  = 200  km/hr

Ex. 7.An aeroplane files along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200,400,600 
and 800km/hr.Find the average speed of the plane around the field. 
Sol. : 
Let each side of the square be x km and let the average speed of the plane around the 
field by y km per hour then , 
 x/200+x/400+x/600+x/800=4x/y?25x/2500?4x/y?y=(2400*4/25)=384 
hence average speed =384 km/hr 
 
Ex. 8.Walking at 5 of its usual speed, a train is 10 minutes too late. Find its usual 
time to cover the journey. 
                            7  
 
Sol. :New speed =5/6 of the usual speed 
New time taken=6/5 of the usual time 
So,( 6/5 of the usual time )-( usual time)=10 minutes. 
=>1/5 of the usual time=10 minutes. 
? usual time=10 minutes 
 
Ex. 9.If a man walks at the rate of 5 kmph, he misses a train by 7 minutes. However, 
if he walks at the rate of 6 kmph, he reaches the station 5 minutes before the arrival 
of the train. Find the distance covered by him to reach the station. 
Sol. Let the required distance be x km 
Difference in the time taken at two speeds=1 min =1/2 hr 
Hence x/5-x/6=1/5<=>6x-5x=6 
?x=6 
Hence, the required distance is 6 km 
            
Ex. 10. A and B are two stations 390 km apart. A train starts from A at 10 a.m. and 
travels towards B at 65 kmph. Another train starts from B at 11 a.m. and travels 
towards A at 35 kmph. At what time do they meet? 
 Sol. Suppose they meet x hours after 10 a.m. Then, 
         (Distance moved by first in x hrs) + [Distance moved by second in (x-1) 
hrs]=390. 
                
65x + 35(x-1) = 390  => 100x = 425  => x = 17/4 
 
 So, they meet 4 hrs.15 min. after 10 a.m i.e., at 2.15 p.m.     
 
Ex. 11. A goods train leaves a station at a certain time and at a fixed speed. After 
^hours, an express train leaves the same station and moves in the same direction at 
a uniform speed of 90 kmph. This train catches up the goods train in 4 hours. Find 
the speed of the goods train. 
 Sol.  Let the speed of the goods train be x kmph. 
          Distance covered by goods train in 10 hours= Distance covered by express 
train in 4 hours 
  10x = 4 x 90 or x =36. 
  So, speed of goods train = 36kmph. 
 
Ex. 12. A thief is spotted by a policeman from a distance of 100 metres. When the 
policeman starts the chase, the thief also starts running. If the speed of the thief be 
8km/hr and that of the policeman 10 km/hr, how far the thief will have run before 
he is overtaken? 
 Sol. Relative speed of the policeman = (10-8) km/hr =2 km/hr. 
Time taken by police man to cover 100m  100   x  1  hr = 1  hr. 
      1000     2         20  
In 1  hrs, the thief covers a distance of 8  x  1  km = 2  km  = 400 m 
   20                                                              20          5    
 
 
Ex.13. I walk a certain distance and ride back taking a total time of 37 minutes. I 
could walk both ways in 55 minutes. How long would it take me to ride both ways? 
 Sol. Let the distance be x km. Then,  
        ( Time taken to walk x km) + (time taken to ride x km) =37 min. 
        ( Time taken to walk 2x km ) + ( time taken to ride 2x km )= 74 min. 
 But, the time taken to walk 2x km = 55 min. 
 Time taken to ride 2x km = (74-55)min =19 min. 
 
 
18. PROBLEMS ON TRAINS 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
1. a km/hr= (a* 5/18) m/s.  
 
2. a m / s = (a*18/5) km/hr. 
 
3 Time taken by a train of length 1 metres to pass a pole or a standing man or a 
signal  post is equal to the time taken by the train to cover 1 metres. 
 
4. Time taken by a train of length 1 metres to pass a stationary object of length  b 
metres is the time taken by the train to cover (1 + b) metres. 
 
5. Suppose two trains or two bodies are moving in the same direction at u m / s and 
v m/s, where u > v, then their relatives speed = (u - v) m / s. 
 
6. Suppose two trains or two bodies are moving in opposite directions at u m / s 
and v m/s, then their relative speed is = (u + v) m/s. 
 
7. If two trains of length a metres and b metres are moving in opposite directions at 
u  m / s and v m/s, then time taken by the trains to cross each other =  (a + b)/(u+v) 
sec. 
 
8.If two trains of length  a metres and b metres are moving in the same direction 
at u m / s and v m / s, then the time taken by the faster  train to cross the slower 
train = (a+b)/(u-v) sec.  
 
9. If two trains (or bodies) start at the same time from points A and B towards each 
other and after crossing they take a and b sec in reaching B and A respectively,

 SOLVED EXAMPLES  
 
Ex.I. A train 100 m long is running at the speed of 30 km / hr. Find the time 
taken  by it to pass a man standing near the railway line. (S.S.C. 
2001) 
 
Sol. Speed of the train = (30 x 5/18_) m / sec = (25/3) m/ sec. 
        Distance moved in passing the standing man = 100 m. 
       Required time taken = 100/(25/3) = (100 *(3/25)) sec = 12 sec 
Ex. 2. A train is moving at a speed of 132 km/br. If the length of the train is 
110 metres, how long will it take to cross a railway platform 165 metres long? 
 (Section Officers', 2003) 
 
Sol. Speed of train = 132 *(5/18) m/sec = 110/3  m/sec. 
    Distance covered in passing the platform = (110 + 165) m = 275 m. 
        
       Time taken =275 *(3/110)  sec =15/2 sec = 7  ½ sec 
  
Ex. 3. A man is standing on a railway bridge which is 180 m long. He finds 
that  a train crosses the bridge in 20 seconds but himself in 8 seconds. Find the 
length of the train and its speed? 
 
Sol. Let the length of the train be x metres, 
 
       Then, the train covers x metres in 8 seconds and (x + 180) metres in 20 sec 
 
     x/8=(x+180)/20 ? 20x = 8 (x + 180) <=> x = 120. 
 
     Length of the train = 120 m. 
 
     Speed of the train = (120/8) m / sec = m / sec = (15 *18/5) kmph = 54 km 
 
Ex. 4. A train 150 m long is running with a speed of 68 kmph. In what time will 
it pass a man who is running at 8 kmph in the same direction in which the train 
is going? 
Sol: Speed of the train relative to man = (68 - 8) kmph 
        = (60* 5/18) m/sec = (50/3)m/sec 
       Time taken by the train to cross the man I 
        = Time taken by It to cover 150 m at 50/3  m / sec = 150 *3/ 50  sec  = 9sec 
 
Ex. 5. A train 220 m long is running with a speed of 59 kmph.. In what will 
it pass a man who is running at 7 kmph in the direction opposite to that in 
which the train is going? 
sol. Speed of the train relative to man = (59 + 7) kmph 
       = 66 *5/18  m/sec = 55/3 m/sec.  
       Time taken by the train to cross the man = Time taken by it to cover 220 m                     
at (55/3) m / sec = (220 *3/55) sec = 12 sec 
 
Ex. 6. Two trains 137 metres and 163 metres in length are running towards 
each other on parallel lines, one at the rate of 42 kmph and another at 48 
kmpb. In what  time will they be clear of each other from the moment they 
meet? 
 
Sol. Relative speed of the trains = (42 + 48) kmph = 90 kmph 
 =(90*5/18) m / sec = 25 m /sec.   
       Time taken by the  trains  to'pass each other 
        = Time taken to cover (137 + 163) m at 25 m /sec =(300/25) sec = 12 sec 
 
  
Ex. 7. Two trains 100  metres and 120 metres long  are running in the same 
direction with speeds of  72 km/hr,In howmuch   time will the first train cross 
the  second? 
 
Sol: Relative speed of the trains = (72 - 54) km/hr = 18 km/hr 
                = (18 * 5/18) m/sec = 5 m/sec. 
       Time taken by the trains to cross each other 
      = Time taken to cover (100 + 120) m at 5 m /sec = (220/5) sec = 44 sec. 
 
Ex. 8. A train  100 metres long takes 6 seconds to cross a man walking at 5 
kmph in the direction  opposite to that of the train. Find the speed of the 
train.? 
 
Sol:Let the speed of the train be x kmph. 
   Speed of the train relative to man = (x + 5) kmph = (x + 5) *5/18 m/sec. 
 
      Therefore 100/((x+5)*5/18)=6 <=> 30 (x + 5) = 1800 <=> x = 55 
        
        Speed of the train is 55 kmph. 
 
Ex9. A train running at 54 kmph takes 20 seconds to pass a platform. Next it 
takes.12 sec  to pass a man walking at 6 kmph in the same direction in which 
the train is going . Find the length of the train and the length of the platform. 
 
Sol:Let the length of train be x metres and length of platform be y metres. 
  
     Speed of the train relative to man = (54 - 6) kmph = 48 kmph 
 
      = 48*(5/18) m/sec = 40/3 m/sec. 
 
     In passing a man, the train covers its own length with relative speed. 
 
     Length of train = (Relative speed * Time) = ( 40/3)*12 m = 160 m. 
 
     Also, speed of the train = 54 *(5/18)m / sec = 15 m / sec. 
 
   (x+y)/15 = 20 <=> x + y = 300 <=> Y = (300 - 160) m = 140 m. 
 
Ex10. A man sitting in a train which is traveling at 50 kmph observes that a 
goods train, traveling in opposite direction, takes 9 seconds to pass him. If the 
goods train is 280 m long, find its speed.? 
 
Sol: Relative speed = 280/9 m / sec = ((280/9)*(18/5)) kmph = 112 kmph. 
 
    Speed of goods train = (112 - 50) kmph = 62 kmph. 
 
  
19.BOATS AND STREAMS 
 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
1.In water ,the direction along the stream is called downstream and ,the direction against 
the stream is called upstream. 
 
2.If the speed of a boat in still water is u km/hr and the speed of the stream is v 
km/hr,then: 
             speed downstream=(u+v)km/hr. 
             speed upstream=(u-v)km/hr. 
 
3.If the speed downstream is a km/hr and the speed upstream is b km/hr,then : 
speed in still water=1/2(a+b)km/hr 
rate of stream=1/2(a-b)km/hr 
 
SOLVED EXAMPLES 
 
EX.1.A man can row upstream at 7 kmph and downstream at 10kmph.find man’s 
rate in still water and the rate of current. 
 
Sol. Rate in still water=1/2(10+7)km/hr=8.5 km/hr. 
Rate of current=1/2(10-7)km/hr=1.5 km/hr. 
 
EX.2. A man takes 3 hours 45 minutes to row a boat 15 km downstream of a river 
and 2hours30minutes to cover a distance of 5km upstream. find the speed of the 
river current in km/hr. 
 
Sol. rate downstream=(15/3 ¾)km/hr=(15*4/15)km/hr=4km/hr. 
Rate upstream=(5/2 ½)km/hr=(5*2/5)km/hr=2km/hr. 
Speed of current=1/2(4-2)km/hr=1km/hr 
 
EX.3. a man can row 18 kmph in still water.it takes him thrice as long to row up as 
to row down the river.find the rate of stream. 
 
Sol. Let man’s rate upstream be x kmph.then ,his rate downstream=3xkmph. 
So,2x=18 or x=9. 
Rate upstream=9 km/hr,rate downstream=27 km/hr. 
Hence,rate of stream=1/2(27-9)km/hr=9 km/hr. 
 
 
EX.4. there is a road beside a river.two friends started from a place A,moved to a 
temple situated at another place B and then returned to A again.one of them moves 
on a cycle at a speed of 12 km/hr,while the other sails on a boat at a speed of 10 
km/hr.if the river flows at the speed of 4 km/hr,which of the two friends will return 
to placeA first? 
Sol. Clearly the cyclist moves both ways at a speed of 12 km/hr. 
The boat sailor moves downstream @ (10+4)i.e.,14 km/hr and upstream @ (10-4)i.e., 
6km/hr. 
So,average speed of the boat sailor=(2*14*6/14+6)km/hr 
                                                       =42/5 km/hr=8.4 km/hr. 
since the average speed of the cyclist is greater ,he will return ta A first. 
 
EX.5. A man can row 7 ½ kmph in still water.if in a river running at 1.5 km/hr an 
hour,it takes him 50 minutes to row to a place and back,how far off is the place? 
 
Sol. Speed downstream =(7.5+1.5)km/hr=9 km/hr; 
Speed upstream=(7.5-1.5)kmph=6kmph. 
Let the required distance be x km.then, 
x/9+x/6=50/60. 
2x+3x=(5/6*18) 
5x=15 
x=3. 
Hence,the required distance is 3km. 
 
EX.6. In a stream running at 2kmph,a motar boat goes 6km upstream and back

IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE  
 
1. Alligation: It is the rule that enables us to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients at the 
given price must be mixed to produce a mixture of a desired price. 
2. Mean Price: The cost price of a unit quantity of the mixture is called the mean price. 
3. Rule of Alligation: If two ingredients are mixed, then 
 
(Quantity of cheaper) = (C.P. of dearer) - (Mean price) 
(Quantity of dearer)       (Mean price) - (C.P. of cheaper)

21. SIMPLE INTEREST 
 
 IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE  
1.. Principal: The money borrowed or lent out for a certain period is called the 
principal or the sum. 
2. Interest: Extra money paid for using other's money is called interest. 
3. Simple Interest (S.I.) : If the interest on a sum borrowed for a certain period is reckoned 
uniformly, then it is called simple interest. 
Let Principal = P, Rate = R% per annum (p.a.) and Time = T years. Then, 
(i) S.I. =  (P*R*T )/100 
  (ii)        P=(100*S.I)/(R*T) ;R=(100*S.I)/(P*T) and T=(100*S.I)/(P*R) 
 
 
 
SOLVED EXAMPLES 
 
Ex. 1. Find the simple interest on Rs. 68,000 at 16 2/3% per annum for 9 months. 
  
   
Sol.  P = Rs.68000,R = 50/3% p.a and T = 9/12 years  = 3/4years. 
 
      ?  S.I. = (P*R*T)/100 = Rs.(68,000*(50/3)*(3/4)*(1/100))= Rs.8500 
 
Ex. 2. Find the simple interest on Rs. 3000 at 6 1/4% per annum for the period from 
4th Feb., 2005 to 18th April, 2005. 
 
Sol. Time = (24+31+18)days = 73 days = 73/365 years = 1/5 years. 
 
         P = Rs.3000 and R = 6 ¼ %p.a = 25/4%p.a 
        ?S.I. = Rs.(3,000*(25/4)*(1/5)*(1/100))= Rs.37.50. 
 
Remark : The day on which money is deposited is not counted while the day on which 
money is withdrawn is counted . 
 
Ex. 3. A sum at simple interests at 13 ½ % per annum amounts to Rs.2502.50 after 4 
years find the sum. 
 
Sol.  Let sum be Rs. x then , S.I.=Rs.(x*(27/2) *4*(1/100) ) = Rs.27x/50 
        ?amount = (Rs. x+(27x/50)) = Rs.77x/50 
        ? 77x/50 = 2502.50 ? x = 2502.50 * 50    = 1625 
                                                             77 
         Hence , sum = Rs.1625. 
 
Ex. 4. A sum of Rs. 800 amounts to Rs. 920 in 8 years at simple intere 
interest rate is increased by 8%, it would amount to bow mucb ? 
Sol. S.l. = Rs. (920 - 800) = Rs. 120; p = Rs. 800, T = 3 yrs. _ 
     . R = ((100 x 120)/(800*3) ) % = 5%. 
       New rate = (5 + 3)% = 8%. 
       New S.l. = Rs. (800*8*3)/100 = Rs. 192. 
:      New amount = Rs.(800+192) = Rs. 992. 
  
Ex. 5. Adam borrowed some money at the rate of 6% p.a. for the first two years , at  the 
rate of 9% p.a. for the next three years , and at the rate of 14% p.a. for the period 
beyond five years. 1£ he pays a total interest of Rs. 11, 400 at the end of nine years how 
much money did he borrow ? 
 
Sol. Let the sum borrowed be x. Then, 
 
(x*2*6)/100 + (x*9*3)/100 + (x*14*4)/100 = 11400  
?  (3x/25 + 27x/100 + 14x / 25) = 11400       ? 95x/100 = 11400 ? x = (11400*100)/95

Ex. 6. A certain sum of money amounts to Rs. 1008 in 2 years and to Rs.1164 in 3 ½ 
years. Find the sum and rate of interests. 
 
Sol.. S.I. for 1 ½ years = Rs.(1164-1008) = Rs.156. 
          S.l. for 2 years = Rs.(156*(2/3)*2)=Rs.208 
           
          Principal = Rs. (1008 - 208) = Rs. 800.  
      
          Now, P = 800, T = 2 and S.l. = 208. 
 
 Rate =(100* 208)/(800*2)% = 13% 
  
Ex. 7. At what rate percent per annum will a sum of money double in 16 years. 
 
           Sol.. Let principal = P. Then, S.l. = P and T = 16 yrs. 
 
                    ?Rate = (100 x P)/(P*16)% = 6 ¼ % p.a.  
  
Ex. 8. The simple interest on a sum of money is 4/9 of the principal .Find the rate 
percent and time, if both are numerically equal.

               ?Rate = 6 2/3 % 
  
and Time = 6 2/3 years = 6 years 8 months. 
 
Ex. 9. The simple interest on a certain sum of money for 2 l/2 years at 12% per 
annum  is Rs. 40 less tban the simple interest on the same sum for 3 ½  years at 10% per 
annum. Find the sum. 
 
        Sol.  Let the sum be Rs. x Then, ((x*10*7)/(100*2)) – ( (x*12*5)/(100*2)) = 40
   
                 ? (7x/20)-(3x/10)=40  
    ?x = (40 * 20) = 800. 
  
 Hence, the sum is Rs. 800. 
 
Ex. 10. A sum was put at simple interest at a certain rate for 3 years. Had it been 
put at 2% higher rate, it would have fetched Rs. 360 more. Find the sum. 
   
   Sol. Let sum = P and original rate = R.  
             Then, [ (P*(R+2)*3)/100] – [ (P*R*3)/100] = 360. 
 
        ? 3PR + 6P - 3PR = 36000 ? 6P=36000 ? P=6000

22.COMPOUND INTEREST 
 
Compound Interest: Sometimes it so happens that the borrower and the lender agree to 
fix up a certain unit of time, say yearly or half-yearly or quarterly to settle the previous 
account. 
 
 In such cases, the amount after first unit of time becomes the principal for the second 
unit,the amount after second unit becomes the principal for the third unit and so on. 
 
 After a specified period, the difference between the amount and the money 
borrowed is called the Compound Interest (abbreviated as C.I.) for that period. 
     
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
Let Principal = P, Rate = R% per annum, Time = n years.  
I. When interest is compound Annually:

2nd and 3rd year                                 
respectively. 
Then, Amount = P(1+R1/100)(1+R2/100)(1+R3/100)

Amount = Rs. 8000 x [1 +5/100]^3 - = Rs. 9261. 
.. C.I. = Rs. (9261 - 8000) = Rs. 1261. 
 
Ex. 6. In what time will Rs. 1000 become Rs. 1331 at 10% per annum compounded 
annually? (S.S.C. 2004) 
 
Sol.  
Principal = Rs. 1000; Amount = Rs. 1331; Rate = 10% p.a.  Let the time be n years. Then, 
[ 1000 (1+ (10/100))
n  
] = 1331 or (11/10)
n =  
(1331/1000) = (11/10)
3 
n = 3 years.  
 
Ex. 7. If Rs. 600 amounts to Rs. 683.20 in two years compounded annually, find the 
rate of interest per annum. 
  
 Sol. Principal = Rs. 500; Amount = Rs. 583.20; Time = 2 years. 
 Let the rate be R% per annum.. 'Then, 
 
 [ 500 (1+(R/100)
2 
] = 583.20 or [ 1+ (R/100)]
2  =  
5832/5000 = 11664/10000 
 
      [ 1+ (R/100)]
2 
= (108/100)
2
  or  1 + (R/100) = 108/100  or  R = 8 
  
 So, rate = 8% p.a. 
 
Ex. 8. If the compound interest on a certain sum at 16 (2/3)% to  3 years is Rs.1270, 
find the simple interest on the same sum at the same rate and f or the same 
period. 
 
Sol. Let the sum be Rs. x. Then, 
  C.I. = [ x * (1 + (( 50/(3*100))
3
 - x ] = ((343x / 216) - x) = 127x / 216 
127x /216 = 1270  or  x = (1270 * 216) / 127  =  2160. 
Thus, the sum is Rs. 2160 
S.I. = Rs  ( 2160 * (50/3) * 3 * (1 /100 ) ) = Rs. 1080.   
   
Ex. 9. The difference between the compound interest and simple interest on a 
certain sum at 10% per annum for 2 years is Rs. 631. Find the sum. 
 
 Sol. Let the sum be Rs. x. Then, 
 C.I. =  x ( 1 + ( 10 /100 ))
2 
- x  =  21x / 100 ,   
              S.I.  = (( x * 10 * 2) / 100) =  x / 5 
 (C.I) - (S.I) = ((21x / 100 ) - (x / 5 )) =  x / 100 
  
Hence, the sum is Rs.63,100. 
 
Ex. 10. The difference between the compound interest and the simple interest accrued 
on an amount of Rs. 18,000 in 2 years was Rs. 405. What was the rate of interest 
p.c.p.a. ?  (Bank P.O. 2003) 
Sol. Let the rate be R% p.a. then, 
[ 18000 ( 1 + ( R / 100 )
2 
) - 18000 ] - ((18000 * R *  2) / 100 ) = 405 
18000 [ ( 100 + (R / 100 )
2 
 / 10000)  -  1 - (2R / 100 ) ]  =  405 
 18000[( (100 + R )
 2
 - 10000 - 200R) / 10000 ]  =  405 
 9R
2
 / 5  =  405  
2
  =((405 * 5 ) / 9) = 225  
 R = 15. 
 Rate = 15%. 
 
Ex. 11. Divide Rs. 1301 between A and B, so that the amount of A after 7 years is equal 
to the amount of B after 9 years, the interest being compounded at 4% per  annum. 
Sol. Let the two parts be Rs. x and Rs. (1301 - x). 
x(1+4/100)
7 
=(1301-x)(1+4/100)
9
 
x/(1301-x)=(1+4/100)
2
=(26/25*26/25) 
625x=676(1301-x) 
1301x=676*1301 
x=676. 
So,the parts are rs.676 and rs.(1301-676)i.e rs.676 and rs.625. 
 
Ex.12. a certain sum amounts to rs.7350 in 2 years and to rs.8575 in 3 years.find the 
sum and rate percent. 
S.I on rs.7350 for 1 year=rs.(8575-7350)=rs.1225. 
Rate=(100*1225/7350*1)%=16 2/3% 
 
Let the sum be rs.x.then, 
X(1+50/3*100)
2
=7350 
X*7/6*7/6=7350 
X=(7350*36/49)=5400. 
Sum=rs.5400. 
 
Ex.13.a sum of money amounts to rs.6690 after 3 years and to rs.10,035 after 6 years 
on compound interest.find the sum. 
Sol. Let the sum be rs.P.then 
P(1+R/100)
3=6690…(i) and  P(1+R/100)
6=10035…(ii) 
On dividing,we get (1+R/100)
3
=10025/6690=3/2. 
Substituting this value in (i),we get: 
P*3/2=6690 or P=(6690*2/3)=4460 
Hence,the sum is rs.4460. 
 
Ex.14. a sum of money doubles itself at compound interest in 15 years.in how many 
years will it beco,e eight times? 
P(1+R/100)
15
=2P 
(1+R/100)

Thus,the required time=45 years. 
 
 
 
Ex.15.What annual payment will discharge a debt of Rs.7620 due in 3years at  
16 2/3% per annum interest? 
 
Sol. Let each installment beRs.x. 
     Then,(P.W. of Rs.x due 1 year hence)+(P>W of Rs.x due 2 years hence)+(P.W of Rs. X due 3     
     years hence)=7620. 
 
? x/(1+(50/3*100))+ x/(1+(50/3*100))
2
 + x/(1+(50/3*100))
3
=7620 
 
?(6x/7)+(936x/49)+(216x/343)=7620. 
 
?294x+252x+216x=7620*343. 
? x=(7620*343/762)=3430. 
?Amount of each installment=Rs.3430. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
23. LOGARITHMS 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
I. Logarithm: If a is a positive real number, other than 1 and a
m
 = X, then we write: 
          m = loga x and we say that the value of log x to the base a is m. 
Example: 
(i) 10
3
 = 1000 => log10 1000 = 3 
(ii) 2
-3
 = 1/8 => log2 1/8 = - 3 
(iii) 3
4
 = 81 => log3 81=4 
(iiii) (.1)
2 
= .01 => log(.l) .01 = 2. 
 
II. Properties of Logarithms: 
1. loga(xy) = loga x + loga y 
2. loga (x/y) = loga x - loga y 
3.logx x=1 
4. loga 1 = 0 
5.loga(x
p
)=p(logax) 1 
6. logax =1/logx a 
7. logax = logb x/logb a=log x/log a. 
  
Remember: When base is not mentioned, it is taken as 10. 
 
II. Common Logarithms:  
         Logarithms to the base 10 are known as common logarithms. 
 
III. The logarithm of a number contains two parts, namely characteristic and mantissa.  
Characteristic: The integral part of the logarithm of a number is called its characteristic. 
 
Case I: When the number is greater than 1. 
In this case, the characteristic is one less than the number of digits in the left of the 
decimal point in the given number. 
 
Case II: When the number is less than 1. 
In this case, the characteristic is one more than the number of zeros between the decimal 
point and the first significant digit of the number and it is negative.  
Instead of - 1, - 2, etc. we write, ?1 (one bar), ?2 (two bar), etc. 
 
 
 
Example: 
 
Number Characteristic Number Characteristic 
348.25 2 0.6173 ?1 
46.583 1 0.03125 ?2 
9.2193 0 0.00125 ?3 
 
Mantissa: The decimal part of the logarithm of a number is known is its mantissa. For 
mantissa, we look through log table.

Ex. 2. A lawn is in the form of a rectangle having its sides in the ratio 2: 3. The 
area of the lawn is (1/6) hectares. Find the length and breadth of the lawn. 
Sol. Let length = 2x metres and breadth = 3x metre. 
Now, area = (1/6 )x 1000 m
2
 = 5000/3m
2
 
So, 2x * 3x = 5000/3 <=> x
2
 = 2500/9 <=> x = 50/3 
therefore Length = 2x = (100/3) m = 33(1/3) m and Breadth = 3x = 3(50/3) m = 50m. 
 
 
Ex. 3. Find the cost of carpeting a room 13 m long and 9 m broad with a carpet 
75 cm wide at the rate of Rs. 12.40 per square metre.

2
 = 117 m
2
. 
Length of the carpet = (area/width) =  117 *(4/3)  m = 156 m.

length of the rectangle. 
 
Sol. Let breadth = x. Then, length = 2x. Then, 
(2x - 5) (x + 5) - 2x * x = 75 <=> 5x - 25 = 75 <=> x = 20. 
:. Length of the rectangle = 20 cm.

Sol. Let x and y be the sides of the rectangle. Then, Correct area = xy. 
Calculated area = (105/100)*x * (96/100)*y = (504/500 )(xy) 
Error In measurement = (504/500)xy- xy = (4/500)xy 
     Error % = [(4/500)xy *(1/xy) *100] % = (4/5) % = 0.8%.

Sol. Area of the plot = (110 x 65) m
2
 = 7150 m
2
 
Area of the plot excluding the path = [(110 - 5) * (65 - 5)] m
2
 = 6300 m
2
. 
Area of the path = (7150 - 6300) m
2
 = 850 m

Ex.12. If each side of a square is increased by 25%, find the percentage change in its area. 
 
Sol. Let each side of the square be a. Then, area = a
2
. 
New side =(125a/100) =(5a/4). New area = (5a/4)
 2
 =(25a
2
)/16. 
Increase in area = ((25 a
2
)/16)-a
2
 =(9a

Ex. 13. If the length of a certain rectangle is decreased by 4 cm and the width is increased by 
3 cm, a square with the same area as the original rectangle would result. Find the perimeter 
of the original rectangle. 
          
          Sol.  Let x and y be the length and breadth of the rectangle respectively. 
                Then, x - 4 = y + 3 or x - y = 7                                                ----(i) 
       Area of the rectangle =xy; Area of the square = (x - 4) (y + 3) 
     (x - 4) (y + 3) =xy <=> 3x - 4y = 12                                         ----(ii) 
Solving (i) and (ii), we get x = 16 and y = 9. 
 Perimeter of the rectangle = 2 (x + y) = [2 (16 + 9)] cm = 50 cm. 
 
 
 
Ex. 14. A room is half as long again as it is broad. The cost of carpeting the at Rs. 5 per sq. m 
is Rs. 270 and the cost of papering the four walls at Rs. 10 per m
2
 is Rs. 1720. If a door and 2 
windows occupy 8 sq. m, find the dimensions of the room. 
 
Sol. Let breadth = x metres, length = 3x metres, height = H metres. 
 
Area of the floor=(Total cost of carpeting)/(Rate/m
2
)=(270/5)m
2
=54m
2
. 
x* (3x/2) = 54 <=> x^2 = (54*2/3) = 36 <=> x = 6. 
So, breadth = 6 m and length =(3/2)*6 = 9 m. 
Now, papered area = (1720/10)m
2
 = 172 m
2
. 
Area of 1 door and 2 windows = 8 m
2
. 
Total area of 4 walls = (172 + 8) m
2
 = 180 m

Ex. 17. The base of a triangular field is three times its altitude. If the cost of cultivating the 
field at Rs. 24.68 per hectare be Rs. 333.18, find its base and height. 
Sol. Area of the field = Total cost/rate = (333.18/25.6)hectares = 13.5 hectares 
? (13.5 x 10000) m
2
 = 135000 m
2
. 
Let altitude = x metres and base = 3x metres. 
Then, (1/2)*  3x * x = 135000 <=>x
2
= 90000 <=>x = 300. 
 Base = 900 m and Altitude = 300 m. 
 
Ex. 18. The altitude drawn to the base of an isosceles triangle is 8 cm and the perimeter is 32

        Sol. Let ABC be the isosceles triangle and AD be the altitude. 
Let AB = AC = x. Then, BC = (32 - 2x). 
Since, in an isosceles triangle, the altitude bisects the base, 
so BD = DC = (16 - x). 
In triangle ADC, AC
2
= AD + DC
2
=>x
2
=(8
2
)+(16-x)
 2
 
=>32x = 320 =>x= 10. 
BC = (32- 2x) = (32 - 20) cm = 12 cm. 
Hence, required area = ((1/2)x*BC * AD) = ((1/2)*12 *10)cm

Then, 
((1/2) X  x  X 3h)/(1/2) X  y X 4h) =4/3 ? x/y =(4/3 X 4/3)=16/9 
Required ratio = 16 : 9. 
 
 
Ex.21. The base of  a parallelogram is twice its height.  If the area of the parallelogram 
is 72 sq. cm, find its height. 
Sol. Let the height of the parallelogram be x. cm. Then, base = (2x) cm. 
 
2x X x =72 ? 2x^2 = 72 ? X ^2=36 ? x=6 
Hence, height of the parallelogram = 6 cm. 
 
Ex. 22. Find the area of a rhombus one side of which measures 20 cm and 01 diagonal 24 cm. 
        Sol. Let other diagonal = 2x cm. 
     Since diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we have: 
(20)2 = (12)2 + (x)2 _ x = ?(20)2 – (12)2= ?256= 16 cm. _I 
So, other diagonal = 32 cm. 
Area of rhombus = (1/2) x (Product of diagonals) = ((1/2)x 24 x 32) cm^2 = 384 cm^2 
 
Ex. 23. The difference between two parallel sides of a trapezium is 4 cm. perpendicular 
distance between them is 19 cm. If the area of the trapezium is 475 find the lengths of the 
parallel sides. (R.R.B. 2002) 
Sol. Let the two parallel sides of the trapezium be a em and b em. 
Then, a - b = 4 
 
And, (1/2) x (a + b) x 19 = 475  ? (a + b) =((475 x 2)/19) ? a + b = 50 
 
Solving (i) and (ii), we get: a = 27, b = 23. 
So, the two parallel sides are 27 cm and 23 cm.

length of the rope. 
Let the length of the rope be R metres. 
Then, ?(R)^2 = (9856 X (7/22)) = 3136? R = 56. 
Length of the rope = 56 m. 
  
Ex. 25. The area of a circular field is 13.86 hectares. Find the cost of fencing it at

26. RACES AND GAMES 
IMPORTANT FACTS 
 
Races: A contest of speed in running, riding, driving, sailing or rowing is called race  
 
Course: The ground or path on which contests are made is called a race course. 
 
Starting Point: The point from which a race begins is known as a starting point.  
 
Winning Point or Goal: The point set to bound a race is called a winning paint or a 
goal.  
 
Winner: The person who first reaches the winning point is called a winner.  
 
 Dead Heat Race: If all the persons contesting a race reach the goal exactly at the same 
time, then the race is said to be a dead heat race. 
 
Start: Suppose A and B are two contestants in a race. If before the start of the race, A is 
at the starting point and B is ahead of A by 12 metres, then we say that 'A gives  B, a 
start of 12 metres. ' 
To cover a race of 100 metres in this case, A will have to cover 100 metres while B  
will  
have to cover only (100 - 12) = 88 metres. i 
In a 100 m race, 'A can give B 12 m' or 'A can give B a start of 12 m' or 'A beats  12 m' 
means that while A runs 100 m, B runs (100 - 12) = 88 m. 
  
Games: 'A game of 100, means that the person among the contestants who scores 100m 
first is the winner. 
If A scores 100 points while B scores only 80 points, then we say that 'A can give B 20 
points. 
 
 SOLVED EXAMPLES : 
 
Ex. 1. In a km race, A beats B by 28 metres or 7 seconds. Find A's time 
over the course. 
  
Sol.  Clearly, B covers 28 m in 7 seconds. 
:. B's time over the course = (278 x 1000) sec = 250 seconds. 
:. A's  time over the course = (250 - 7-) sec = 243 sec = 4 min. 3 sec. 
 
Ex. 2. A  runs 1 ¾  times as fast as B. if A gives B a start of 84 m, bow far must  
winning post be so that A and B might reach it at the same time? 
  
Sol. Ratio of the rates of A and B =  7/4  : 1   = 7 : 4. 
So, in a race of 7 m, A gains 3m over B. 
:. 3 m are gained by A in a race of 7 m. 
:. 84 m are gained by A in a race of (7/3 x 84) m = 196 m. 
:. Winning post must be 196 m away from the starting point. 
 
 
Ex. 3. A can run 1 km in 3 min. 10 sec. and B can cover the same distance in  3 
min. 20 sec. By what distance can A beat B ? 
 
Soln:Clearly, A beats B by 10 sec. 
Distance covered by B in 10 sec. = (1000 x 10 )m = 50 m.  
             200               
Therefore  A beats B by 50 metres. 
 
 
Ex .4 . In a 100 m race, A runs at 8km  per hour. If A gives B a start of 4 m and 
still him by 15 seconds, what is the speed of B ? 
  
Sol: Time taken by A to cover 100 m  =(60 X 60 / 8000) x 100 sec = 45 sec. 
B covers (100 - 4) m  =  96 m   in  (45 + 15) sec = 60 sec. 
B's speed  = (96 x 60 x 60  )km/hr = 5.76 km/hr.  
                        60 x 1000 
 
 
Ex. 5. A, Band C  are three contestants in a km race. If A can give B a start of 40 m 
    and A can give C  a start of 64m  how many metre's  start can B give C ? 
 
     Sol:   While A covers 1000 m, B covers (1000 - 40) m = 960 m and  
     C covers (1000 - 64) m or 936 m. 
 When B covers 960 m, C covers 936 m. 
  
 Ex 6. In a game of 80 points; A can give B 5 points  and C 15  points. Then how 
many points  B can give C  in a game of 60 ? 
 
Sol.    A: B = 80 : 75,   A : C = 80 : 65. 
B/C  = ( B/ A *  A/C)  = (75 / 80 * 80 / 65)  = 15/13 = 60 /52 = 60: 5 
Therfore ,In a game of 60, B can give C  8 points.

27. CALENDAR 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FOAMULAE 
Under this heading we mainly deal with finding the day of the week on a particular 
given date the  process of finding it lies on obtaining the number of odd days. 
 
Odd Days : Number of days more than the complete number of weeks in a given 
 
Period ., is the number of odd days during that period. 
 
LeapYear: Every year which is divisible by 4 is called a leap year. 
 
Thus each one of the years 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, etc. is a leap year. Every 
4th century is a leap year but no other century is a leap year.thus each one of 400, 
800, 1200,' 1600, 2000, etc. is a leap year. 
None of 1900, 2010, 2020, 2100, etc. is a leap year. 
 
An year which is not a leap year is called an ordinary year. 
 
(I )An ordinary year has 365 days. (II) A leap  year has 366 days. 
 
Counting of Odd Days: 
 
i)1 ordinary year = 365 days = (52 weeks + 1 day). 
:. An ordinary year has 1 odd day. 
ii)1 leap year = 366 days = (52 weeks + 2 days). 
:. A leap year has 2 odd days. 
_          iii)100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years 
= [(76 x 52) weeks + 76 days) + [(24 x 52) weeks + 48 days] 
= 5200 weeks + 124 days = (5217 weeks + 5 days). 
:. 100 years contain 5 odd days. 
200 years contain 10 and therefore 3 odd days. 
300 years contain 15 and therefore 1 odd day. 
400 years contain (20 + 1) and therefore 0 odd day. 
Similarly, each one of 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, etc. contains 0 odd days. 
Remark: (7n + m) odd days, where m < 7 is equivalent to m odd days. 
Thus, 8 odd days ? 1 odd day etc. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SOLVED EXAMPLES 
 
Ex: 1.Wbat was the day of the week on, 16th July, 1776? 
 
Sol:  16th July, 1776 = (1775 years + Period from 1st Jan., 1776 to 16th July, 
1776) 
Counting of odd days : 
1600 years have 0 odd day. 100 years have 5 odd days. 
75 years = (18 leap years + 57 ordinary years) 
= [(18 x 2) + (57 x 1)] odd days = 93 odd days 
= (13 weeks + 2 days) = 2 odd days. 
 
.. 1775 years have (0 + 5 + 2) odd days = 7 odd days = 0 odd day. 
Jan.  Feb.  March   April   May   June   July 
31   + 29  +   31    +  30   +  31  +  30  +16 = 198days 
= (28 weeks + 2 days) =2days 
:. . Total number of odd days = (0 + 2) = 2. Required day was 'Tuesday'. 
 
Ex. 2. What was the day of the week on 16th August, 1947? 
 
Sol. 15th August, 1947 = (1946 years + Period from 1st Jan., 1947 to 15th 
Counting of odd days: 
1600 years have 0 odd day. 300 years have 1 odd day. 
47 years = (11 leap years + 36 ordinary years) 
= [(11 x 2) + (36 x 1») odd days = 58 odd days = 2 odd days. 
Jan. Feb. March April May June July Aug. 
31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 
= 227 days = (32 weeks + 3 days) = 3, 
Total number of odd days = (0 + 1 + 2 + 3) odd days = 6 odd days. 
Hence, the required day was 'Saturday'. 
No of

Ex. 3. What was the day of the week on 16th April, 2000 ? 
 
Sol. 16th April, 2000 = (1999 years + Period from 1st Jan., 2000 to 16thA' 
Counting of odd days: 
1600 years have 0 odd day. 300 years have 1 odd day. 
99 years = (24 leap years + 75 ordinary years) 
= [(24 x 2) + (75 x 1)] odd days = 123 odd days 
= (17 weeks + 4 days) = 4 odd days. 
Jan. Feb. March April 
31 + 29 + 31 + 16 = 107 days = (15 weeks + 2 days) = 2 odd, 
Total number of odd days = (0 + 1 + 4 + 2) odd days = 7 odd days = 0 odd 
day.   Hence, the required day was 'Sunday'. 
 
 
Ex. 4. On what dates of Jull.2004 did Monday fall? 
 
Sol   . Let us find the day on 1st July, 2004. 
2000 years have 0 odd day. 3 ordinary years have 3 odd days. 
Jan. Feb. March April May June July 
31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 1 
= 183 days = (26 weeks + 1 day) = 1 t . 
Total number of odd days = (0 + 3 + 1) odd days = 4 odd days. ' 
:. 1st July 2004 was 'Thursday',-,- 
Thus, 1st Monday in July 2004 _as on 5th July. 
Hence, during July 2004, Monday fell on 5th, 12th, 19th and 26th. . 
 
 
Ex. 5. Prove that the calendar for the year 2008 will serve for the year 20ll  
 
Sol. In order that the calendar for the year 2003 and 2014 be the same, 1
st
  January 
of  both the years must be on the same day of the week. 
For this, the number of odd days between 31st Dec., 2002 and 31st Dec.,2013 must 
be the same. 
We know that an ordinary year has 1 odd day and a leap year has 2 odd During this 
period, there are 3 leap years, namely 2004, 2008 and 2012 and 8 ordinary years. 
Total number of odd days = (6 + 8) days = 0 odd day. 
Hence, the calendar for 2003 will serve for the year 2014. 
 
Ex. 6. Prove that any date in March of a year is the same day of the week 
corresponding date in November that year. 
 
We will show that the number of odd days between last day of February and last  
day of October is zero. . 
March    April    May    June    July    Aug.    Sept.   Oct. 
31     +   30  +  31    + 30   + 31 +   31  +    30   +  31 
= 241 days = 35 weeks = 0 odd day. ,Number of 
odd days during this period = O. 
Thus, 1st March of an year will be the same day as 1st November of that year. 
Hence, the result follows. 
 
 
                                
 
28. CLOCKS 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS 
 
The Face or dial of a watch is a circle whose circumference is divided into 60  
equal parts, called  minute spaces. 
A clock  has two hands, the smaller one is called the hour hand or short hand 
while the larger one is called the minute hand or long hand.. 
i) In 60 minutes, the minute hand gains 55 minutes on the hour hand. 
ii) In every hour, both the hands coincide once. 
iii) The hands are in the same straight line when they are coincident or opposite to 
each other. 
iv) When the two hands are at right angles, they are 15 minute spaces apart. 
v)When the hand's are in opposite directions, they are 30 minute spaces apart. 
 vi)Angle traced by hour hand in 12 hrs = 360°. 
vii)Angle traced by minute hand in 60 min. = 360°. 
 
Too Fast and Too Slow: If a watch or a clock indicates 8.15, when the correct 
time , 8 is said to be 15 minutes too fast. 
On the other hand, if it indicates 7.45, when the correct time is 8, it is said to be 
15 minutes too slow. 
 
SOLVED EXAMPLES 
 
Ex 1:Find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock when 
3.25. 
 
Solution:angle  traced by the hour hand in 12 hours = 360° 
Angle traced by it in three hours 25 min (ie) 41/12 hrs=(360*41/12*12)° 
=102*1/2° 
angle traced by minute hand in 60 min. = 360°. 
Angle traced by it in 25 min. = (360 X 25 )/60= 150° 
Required angle = 1500 – 102*1/2°= 47*1/2° 
 
Ex 2:At what time between 2 and 3 o'clock will the hands of a clock be together? 
 
Solution: At 2 o'clock, the hour hand is at 2 and the minute hand is at 12, i.e. they 
are 10 min  spaces apart. 
To be together, the minute hand must gain 10 minutes over the hour hand. 
Now, 55 minutes are gained by it in 60 min. 
10 minutes will be  gained in (60 x 10)/55  min. = 120/11 min. 
The hands will coincide at 120/11 min. past 2. 
 
Ex. 3. At what time between 4 and 5 o'clock will the hands of a clock be at right 
angle? 
 
 Sol: At 4 o'clock, the minute hand will be 20 min. spaces behind the hour hand, 
Now, when the two hands are at right angles, they are 15 min. spaces apart. So, 
they are at right angles in following two cases. 
       Case I. When minute hand is 15 min. spaces behind the hour hand: 
In this case min. hand will have to gain (20 - 15) = 5 minute spaces. 55 min. spaces 
are gained by it in 60 min. 
 
 5 min spaces will be gained by it in 60*5/55  min=60/11min. 
 
:. They are at right angles at 60/11min. past 4. 
Case II. When the minute hand is 15 min. spaces ahead of the hour hand: 
To be in this position, the minute hand will have to gain (20 + 15) = 35 minute spa' 
55 min. spaces are gained in 60 min. 
35 min spaces are  gained in (60 x 35)/55 min =40/11 
  
 :. They are at right angles at 40/11 min. past 4. 
 
Ex. 4. Find at what time between 8 and 9 o'clock will the hands of a clock 
being  the same straight line but not together. 
         
       Sol: At 8 o'clock, the hour hand is at 8 and the minute hand is at 12, i.e. the two 
hands_ are 20 min. spaces apart. 
To be in the same straight line but not together they will be 30 minute spaces apart. 
So, the minute hand will have to gain (30 - 20) = 10 minute spaces over the hour 
hand. 
55 minute spaces are gained. in 60 min. 
10 minute spaces will be gained in (60 x 10)/55 min. = 120/11min. 
:. The hands will be in the same straight line but not together at 120/11 min.  
 
Ex. 5. At what time between 5 and 6 o'clock are the hands of a clock 
3minapart? 
  
. Sol. At 5 o'clock, the minute hand is 25 min. spaces behind the hour hand. 
       Case I. Minute hand is 3 min. spaces behind the hour hand. 
In this case, the minute hand has to gain' (25 - 3) = 22 minute spaces. 55 min. are 
gained in 60 min. 
22 min. are gaineg in (60*22)/55min. = 24 min. 
:. The hands will be 3 min. apart at 24 min. past 5. 
 Case II. Minute hand is 3 min. spaces ahead of the hour hand. 
In this case, the minute hand has to gain (25 + 3) = 28 minute spaces. 55 min. are 
gained in 60 min. 
 28 min. are gained in  (60 x 28_)/55=346/11 
The hands will be 3 min. apart at 346/11 min. past 5. 
 
 
Ex 6. Tbe minute hand of a clock overtakes the hour hand at intervals of 65 
minutes of the correct time. How much a day does the clock gain or lose? 
     
   Sol: In a correct clock, the minute hand gains 55 min. spaces over the hour hand in 
60 minutes. 
To be together again, the minute hand must gain 60 minutes over the hour hand. 55 
min. are gained in 60 min. 
60 min are gained in  60 x 60 min =720/11 min. 
                                   55 
 
But, they are together after 65 min. 
Gain in 65 min =720/11-65 =5/11min. 
 
Gain in 24 hours =(5/11 * (60*24)/65)min =440/43 
The clock gains 440/43  minutes in 24 hours. 
 
Ex. 7. A watch which gains uniformly, is 6 min. slow at 8 o'clock in the 
morning Sunday and it is 6 min. 48 sec. fast at 8 p.m. on following Sunday. 
When was it correct? 
 
Sol. Time from 8 a.m. on Sunday to 8 p.m. on following Sunday = 7 days 12 hours 
= 180 hours 
 
The watch gains (5 + 29/5) min. or 54/5 min. in 180 hrs. 
Now 54/5  min. are gained in 180 hrs. 
5 min. are gained in (180 x 5/54 x 5) hrs. = 83 hrs 20 min. = 3 days 11 hrs 20 min. 
Watch is correct 3 days 11 hrs 20 min. after 8 a.m. of Sunday. 
It will be correct at 20 min. past 7 p.m. on Wednesday. 
 
 
Ex 8. A clock is set right at 6 a.m. The clock loses 16 minutes in 24 hours. 
What will be the true time when the clock indicates 10 p.m. on 4th day?  
 
Sol. Time from 5 a.m. on a day to 10 p.m. on 4th day = 89 hours. 
 Now 23 hrs 44 min. of this clock = 24 hours of correct clock. 
 
356/15 hrs of this clock = 24 hours of correct clock. 
 89 hrs of this clock = (24 x 31556 x 89) hrs of correct clock. 
 = 90 hrs of correct clock. 
 So, the correct time is 11 p.m. 
 
  
Ex. 9. A clock is set right at 8 a.m. The clock gains 10 minutes in 24 hours will 
be the true time when the clock indicates 1 p.m. on the following day? 
  
Sol. Time from 8 a.m. on a day  1 p.m. on the following day = 29 hours. 
 24 hours 10 min. of this clock = 24 hours of the correct clock. 
145 /6  hrs of this clock = 24 hrs of the correct clock 
 
29 hrs of this clock = (24 x  6/145 x 29) hrs of the correct clock 
= 28 hrs 48 min. of correct clock 
The correct time is 28 hrs 48 min. after 8 a.m.  
This is 48 min. past 12. 
 
 
  29. STOCKS AND SHARES 
 
To start a big business or an industry, a large amount of money is needed. It is beyond 
the capacity of one or two persons to arrange such a huge amount. However, some persons 
associate together to form a company. They, then, draft a proposal, issue a prospectus(in the 
name of company), explaining the plan of the project and invite the public to invest money in 
this project. They, thus, pool up the funds from the public, by assigning them shares of the 
company. 
 
      IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
1. Stock-capital: The total amount needed to run the company is called the stock-
capital 
2. Shares or stock: The whole capital is divided into small units, called shares or 
stock. 
For each investment, the company issues a share-certificate, showing the value 
of each share and the number of shares held by a person. 
The person who subscribers in shares or stock is called a share holder or stock 
holder. 
3. Dividend: The annual profit distributed among share holders is called dividend. 
Dividend is paid annually as per share or as a percentage. 
4. Face Value: The value of a share or stock printed on the share-certificate is 
called its Face Value or Nominal Value or Par Value. 
5. Market Value: The stocks of different companies are sold and bought in the 
open market through brokers at stock-exchanges. A share (or stock) is said to 
be: 
(i) At premium or Above par, if its market value is more than its 
face value. 
(ii) At par, if its market value is the same as its face value. 
(iii) At discount or Below par, if its market value is less than its 
face value. 
Thus, if a Rs.100 stock is quoted at a premium of 16, then market value of the 
stock = Rs. (100+16) = Rs. 116. 
Likewise, I f a Rs. 100 stock is quoted at a discount of 7, then market value of 
the stock = Rs. (100-7) = Rs. 93. 
6. Brokerage: The broker’s charge is called brokerage. 
(i) When stock is purchased, brokerage is added to the cost price. 
(ii) When stock is sold, brokerage is subtracted from the selling 
price. 
Remember: 
(i) The face value of a share always remains the same. 
(ii) The market value of a share changes form time to time. 
(iii) Dividend is always paid on the face value of a share. 
(iv) Number of shares held by a person 
=      Total Investment_ =    _Total Income    _  =      _Total Face Value 
    Investment in 1 share      Income from  1 share      face Value of 1 share 
 
Thus, by a Rs. 100, 9% stock at 120, we mean that: 
(i) Face Value (N>V) of stock = Rs. 100. 
(ii) Market Value (M>V) of stock = Rs. 120. 
(iii) Annual dividend on 1 share = 9% of face value = 9% of Rs. 100 = Rs. 9. 
(iv) An investment of Rs. 120 gives an annual income of Rs. 9. 
(v) Rate of interest p.a = Annual income from an investment of Rs. 100. 
       =   (9/120 * 100) % = 7 (1/2) %. 
 
 
 
                   SOLVED  EXAMPLES       
 
 
Ex. 1. Find the cost of: 
 (i) Rs. 7200, 8% stock at 90; 
 (ii) Rs. 4500, 8.5% stock at 4 premium; 
 (iii) Rs. 6400, 10% stock at 15 discount. 
 
Sol.     (i) Cost of Rs. 100 stock = Rs. 90 
          Cost of Rs. 7200 stock = Rs. (90/100 * 7200 ) = Rs. 6480. 
 
          (ii) Cost of Rs. 100 stock = Rs. (100+4) 
           Cost of Rs. 4500 stock = Rs. (104/100 * 4500 ) = Rs. 4680 
  
        (iii) Cost of Rs. 100 stock = Rs. (100-15) 
         Cost of Rs. 6400 stock = Rs. (85/100 * 6400 ) = Rs. 5440. 
 
Ex. 2. Find the cash required to purchase Rs. 3200, 7(1/2) % stock at 107                                 
(brokerage (1/2) %) 
 
Sol.  Cash required to purchase Rs. 100 stock = Rs (107+(1/2)) = Rs. (215/2). 
         Cash required to purchase Rs. 100 stock = Rs [(215/2)*(1/100)*3200] = Rs. 3440. 
 
Ex. 3. Find the cash realised by selling Rs.  2440, 9.5% stock at 4 discount 
(brokerage (1/4) %) 
 
Sol. By selling Rs. 100 stock , cash realised = Rs. [(100-4)-(1/4)] = Rs. (383/4). 
        By selling Rs. 2400 stock, cash realised = Rs. [(383/4)*(1/100)*2400] = Rs 2298. 
 
Ex. 4. Find the annual income derived from Rs. 2500, 8% stock at 106. 
 
Sol. Income from Rs. 100 stock = Rs. 8. 
       Income from Rs. 2500 = Rs. [(8/1000*2500) =Rs. 200. 
 
Ex. 5. Find the annual income derived by investing Rs. 6800 in 10% stock at 136. 
 
Sol. By investing Rs. 136, income obtained = Rs. 10. 
      By investing Rs. 6800, income obtained = Rs. [(10/136)*6800] = Rs. 500. 
 
Ex. 6. Which is better investment? 7(1/2) % stock at 105 or 6(1/2) % at 94. 
 
Sol. Let the investment in each case be Rs. (105*94). 
 
        Case I : 7(1/2) 5 stock at 105: 
  On investing Rs. 105, income = Rs. (15/2). 
  On investing Rs. (105*94), income = Rs. [(15/2)*(1/105)*105*94] = Rs 705. 
 
        Case II : 6(1/2) % stock at 94: 
   On investing Rs. 94, income = Rs. (13/2). 
   On investing Rs. (105*94), income  = Rs. [(13/2)*(1/94)*105*94] = Rs. 682.5. 
   Clearly, the income from 7(1/2) % stock at 105 is more. 
   Hence, the investment in 7(1/2) % stock at 105 is better. 
 
Ex. 7. Find the cost of 96 shares of Rs. 10 each at (3/4) discount, brokerage being         
(1/4) per share. 
 
Sol. Cost of 1 share = Rs. [(10-(3/4)) + (1/4)] = Rs. (19/2). 
        Cost of 96 shares = Rs. [(19/2)*96] = Rs. 912. 
 
Ex. 8. Find the income derived from 88 shares of Rs. 25 each at 5 premium, 
brokerage being (1/4) per share and the rate of dividend being 7(1/2) % per 
annum. Also, find the rate of interest on the investment. 
 
Sol. Cost of 1 share = Rs. [25+5+1/4)] = Rs. (121/4). 
       Cost of 88 shares = Rs.[(121/4)*88] = Rs. 2662. 
  ? Investment made = Rs. 2662. 
       Face value of 88 shares = Rs. (88*25) = Rs. 2200. 
       Dividend on Rs. 100 = (15/2). 
       Dividend on Rs. 2200 = Rs. [(15/20*(1/100)*2200] = Rs. 165. 
  ? Income derived = Rs. 165. 
       Rate of interest on investment = [(165/2662)*100] = 6.2 %. 
 
Ex. 9. A man buys Rs. 25 shares in   company which pays 9 % dividend. The 
money invested is such that it gives 10 % on investment. At what price did he buy 
the shares? 
 
Sol. Suppose he buys each share for Rs. x. 
        Then, [25*(9/100)] = [x*(10/100)] or x = Rs. 22.50. 
        Cost of each share = Rs. 22.50. 
 
Ex. 10. A man sells Rs.5000, 12 % stock at 156 and uinvests the proceeds parity in 
8 % stock at 90 and 9 % stock at 108. He hereby increases his income by Rs. 70. 
How much of the proceeds were invested in each stock? 
 
Sol. S.P of Rs. 5000 stock = Rs. [(156/100)*5000] = Rs. 7800. 
       Income from this stock = Rs. [(12/100)*5000] = Rs. 600. 
       Let investment in * % stock be x and that in 9 % stock = (7800-x). 
  ? [x*(8/90)] + (7800-x) * (9/108) = (600+7) 
  ?  (4x/45) + [(7800-x)/12] = 670 ? 16x + 117000-15x = (670*180) ? x = 3600. 
   ? Money invested in 8 % stock at 90 = Rs. 3600. 
         Money invested in 9 % at 108 = Rs. (7800-3600) = Rs. 4200. 
         
                  
30. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
Factorial Notation: Let n be a positive integer.  Then, factorial n, denoted by n!  is 
defined as: 
                             
  n! = n(n-1)(n-2)........3.2.1. 
 
Examples: (i) 5! = (5x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) = 120; (ii) 4! = (4x3x2x1) = 24 etc. 
We define, 0! = 1. 
 
Permutations:  The different arrangements of a given number of things by taking some 
or all at a time, are called permutations. 
 
Ex. 1.All permutations (or arrangements) made with the letters a, b, c by taking  two at a 
time are: (ab, ba, ac, bc, cb). 
 
Ex. 2.All permutations made with the letters a,b,c, taking all at a time are:  
(abc, acb, bca, cab, cba). 
 
Number of Permutations: Number of all permutations of n things, taken r  at a time, 
given by: 
 
  
n
Pr  = n(n-1)(n-2).....(n-r+1) = n!/(n-r)! 
 
Examples: (i) 
6
p2 = (6x5) = 30. (ii) 
7
p3 = (7x6x5) = 210. 
 
Cor. Number of all permutations of n things, taken all at a time = n! 
 
An Important Result: If there are n objects of  which p1 are alike of  one kind; p2 are 
alike of another kind; p3 are alike of third kind and  so on and pr are alike of rth kind, such 
that (p1+p2+.......pr) = n. 
 
Then, number of permutations of these n objects is: 
 
  n!  /  (p1!).p2!)......(pr!) 
 
Combinations: Each of the different groups or selections which can be formed by taking 
some or all of a number of objects, is called a combination. 
 
Ex. 1. Suppose we want to select two out of three boys A, B, C.  Then, possible 
selections are AB, BC and CA. 
Note that AB and BA represent the same selection. 
 
 
Ex. 2. All the combinations formed by a, b, c, taking two at a time are ab, bc, ca. 
 
Ex. 3. The only combination that can be formed of three letters a, b, c taken all at a time 
is abc. 
 
Ex. 4. Various groups of 2 out of four presons A, B, C, D are: 
 
  AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. 
 
Ex. 5. Note that ab and ba are two different permutations but they represent  the same 
combination. 
 
Number of Combinations: The number of all combination of n things, 
taken r at a time is: 
 
 
n
Cr = n! / (r!)(n-r)! = n(n-1)(n-2).....to r factors / r! 
 
Note that: 
n
cr  = 1 and 
n
c0 = 1. 
 
An Important Result:  
n
cr = 
n
c(n-r). 
 
Example:  (i)

p5 = 5! = (5x4x3x2x1) = 120. 
 
Ex. 5. How many words can be formed by using all letters of the word ‘DAUGHTER’ so 
that the vowels always come together? 
 
Sol.  Given word contains 8 different letters.  When the vowels AUE are always together, 
we may suppose them to form an entity, treated as one letter. 
Then, the letters to be arranged are DGNTR (AUE). 
 
Then 6 letters to be arranged in 
6
p6 = 6! = 720 ways. 
 
The vowels in the group (AUE) may be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. 
 
Required number of words = (720x6) = 4320. 
 
Ex. 6. How many words can be formed from the letters of the word ‘EXTRA’ so that the 
vowels are never together? 
 
Sol.  The given word contains 5 different letters. 
        Taking the vowels EA together, we treat them as one letter. 
        Then, the letters to be arranged are XTR (EA). 
        These letters can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. 
        The vowels EA may be arranged amongst themselves in 2! = 2 ways. 
        Number of words, each having vowels together = (24x2) = 48 ways. 
       Total number of words formed by using all the letters of the given words 
                           = 5! = (5x4x3x2x1) = 120. 
 
Number of words, each having vowels never together = (120-48) = 72. 
 
 
Ex. 7.  How many words can be formed from the letters of the word ‘DIRECTOR’ 
So that the vowels are always together? 
 
Sol. In the given word, we treat the vowels IEO as one letter. 
       Thus, we have DRCTR (IEO). 
       This group has 6 letters of which R occurs 2 times and others are different. 
       Number of ways of arranging these letters = 6!/2! = 360. 
       Now 3 vowels can be arranged among themselves in 3! = 6 ways. 
       Required number of ways = (360x6) = 2160.

31. PROBABILITY 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULA 
 
1.Experiment :An operation which can produce some well -defined outcome is 
called an experiment  
 
2.Random experiment:  An experiment in which all possible outcome are 
known and the exact out put cannot be predicted in advance is called an 
random experiment  
Eg of performing random experiment:  
(i)rolling an unbiased dice 
(ii)tossing a fair coin 
(iii)drawing a card from a pack of well shuffled card  
(iv)picking up a ball of certain color from a bag containing ball of  different 
colors 
 
Details: 
(i)when we throw a coin. Then either a head(h) or a tail (t) appears. 
(ii)a dice is a solid cube, having 6 faces ,marked 1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively when 
we throw a die , the outcome is the number that appear on its top face .  
(iii)a pack of cards has 52 cards it has 13 cards of each suit ,namely spades,  
clubs ,hearts and diamonds 
       Cards of spades  and clubs are black cards  
       Cards of hearts  and diamonds are red cards  
       There are 4 honors of each suit 
       These are aces ,king ,queen and jack 
       These are called face cards  
 
3.Sample space :When we perform an experiment ,then the set S of all  
possible outcome is called the sample space 
eg of sample space: 
(i)in tossing a coin ,s={h,t} 
(ii)if two coin are tossed ,then s={hh,tt,ht,th}. 
(iii)in rolling a die we have,s={1,2,3,4,5,6}.  
 
4.event:Any subset of a sample space. 
5.Probability of  occurrence of an event.  
let S be the sample space and E be the event .  
then,E?S. 
P(E)=n(E)/n(S). 
 
6.Results on Probability: 
(i)P(S) = 1  (ii)0<P(E)<1    (iii)P(?)=0 
(iv)For any event  a and b, we have:

32. TRUE DISCOUNT 
 
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS 
 
Suppose a man has to pay Rs. 156 after 4 years and the rate of 
interest is 14% per annum. Clearly, Rs. 100 at 14% will amount to 
Rs. 156 in 4 years. So, the payment of Rs. 100 now will clear off 
the debt of Rs. 156 due 4 years hence. We say that: 
Sum due = Rs. 156 due 4 years hence; 
Present Worth (P.W.) = Rs. 100; 
True Discount (T.D.) = Rs. (156 - 100) = Rs. 56  
 (Sum due) - (P.W.). 
We define :  T.D. = Interest on P.W. 
Amount = (P.W.) + (T.D.). 
 Interest is reckoned on P.W. and true discount is reckoned on the 
amount. 
 
IMPORTANT FORMULAE 
 
Let rate = R% per annum and Time = T years. Then, 
1. P.W.=[100 x Amount  /100 + (R x T)  
                  =100 x T.D./ RxT 
2.  T.D.=[(P.W.) x R x T /100]   
                = [ Amount x RxT/100 + (R x T)] 
3.(S.I.)*(T.D.) /(S.I.)-(T.D.)  
4. (S.I.) - (T.D.) - S.I. on T.D. 
 
 5. When the sum is put at compound interest, then 
 P.W. = Amount/[1 +R/100]^T 
 
SOLVED EXAMPLES 
 
Ex. 1. Find the present worth of Rs. 930 due 3 years hence at 
8% per annum. Also find the discount. 
Sol. 
 P.W=100 x Amount /[100 + (R x T)] 
 
=Rs.100 x 930/100+ (8x3) 
= (100x930)/124 
 = Rs. 750, 
T.D. = (Amount) - (P.W.) = Rs. (930 - 750) = Rs. 180. 
 
Ex. 2. The true discount on a bill due 9 months hence at 12% 
per annum is Rs. Find the amount of the bill and its present 
worth. 
 
Sol.    Let amount be Rs. x. Then, 
x*R*T/100 + (R x T) 
=T.D. 
=>x * 12*3/ 4/[100+[12*3/4]] 
=540 
x= 540x109  = Rs.6540 
Amount - Rs. 6540. P.W. = Rs. (6540 - 540) - Rs. 6000. 
 
 
Ex. 3. The true discount on a certain sum of money due 3 years 
hence is Rb. 250 and the simple interest on the same sum for 
the same time and at the same rate is Rs. 375. Find the sum 
and the rate percent. 
 
Sol.    T.D. = Rs. 250 and S.I. = Rs. 375. 
Sum due =S.I. xT.D./ S.I. -T.D. 
 
=375x250/375- 250    
=Rs.750. 
Rate=[100*375/750*3]%=16 2/3% 
 
Ex. 4. The difference between the simple interest and true 
discount on a certain sum 
of money for 6 months at 12—% per annum is Rs. 25. Find the 
sum. 
 
Sol.    Let the sum be Rs. x. Then, 
T.D. = (x*25/2*1/2)/(100+(25/2*1/2))=x*25/4*4/425=x/17 
S.I=x*25/2*1/2*1/100=x/16 
x/16-x/17=25 
=>17x-16x=25*16*17 
=>x=6800 
Hence, sum due = Rs. 6800. 
 
Ex. 5. A bill falls due in 1 year. The creditor agrees to accept 
immediate payment of the half and to defer the payment of the 
other half for 2 years. By this arrangement 
ins Rb. 40. What is the amount of the bill, if the money be 
worth 12-z% ? 
Sol.    Let the sum be Rs. x. Then, 
[x/2+(x/2*100)/100+(25/2*2)]-[(x*100)/(100+25/2*1] 
 
=40 
=>x/2+2x/5-8x/9=40 
=>x=3600 
Amount of the bill - Rs. 3600. 
 
 
33. BANKER'S DISCOUNT 
 
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS 
Banker's Discount : Suppose a merchant A buys goods worth, say Rs. 10,000 from 
another merchant B at a credit of say 5 months. Then, B prepares a bill, called the bill of 
exchange. A signs this bill and allows B to withdraw the amount from his bank account 
after exactly 5 months. 
The date exactly after 5 months is called nominally due date. Three days (known as grace 
days) are added to it to get a date, known as legally due date. 
 
Suppose B wants to have the money before the legally due date. Then he can have the 
money from the banker or a broker, who deducts S.I. on the face value (i.e., Rs. 10,000 in 
this case) for the period from the date on which the bill was discounted (i.e., paid by the 
banker) and the legally due date. This amount is known as Banker's Discount (B.D.) 
Thus, B.D. is the S.I. on the face value for the period from the date on which the bill was 
discounted and the legally due date. 
 
Banker's Gain (B.G.) = (B.D.) - (T.D.) for the unexpired time. 
Note : When the date of the bill is not given, grace days are not to be added. 
 
IMPORTANT FORMULAE

SOLVED EXAMPLES 
 
Ex. 1. A bill for Rs. 6000 is drawn on July 14 at 5 months. It is discounted on 5th 
October at 10%. Find the banker's discount, true discount, banker's gain and the 
money that the holder of the bill receives. 
 Sol. 
Face value of the bill = Rs. 6000. 
Date on which the bill was drawn = July 14 at 5 months. Nominally due date =                   
December 14. 
Legally due date = December 17. 
Date on which the bill was discounted = October 5.  
Unexpired time  : Oct.                Nov.                Dec. 
                               26     +          30       +       17     = 73 days  =1/ 5Years 
 B.D. = S.I. on Rs. 6000 for 1/5 year  
= Rs.   (6000 x 10 x1/5 x1/100)= Rs. 120. 
 
T.D. = Rs.[(6000 x 10 x1/5)/(100+(10*1/5))] 
 =Rs.(12000/102)=Rs. 117.64. 
 
B.G. = (B.D.) - (T.D.) = Rs. (120 - 117.64) = Rs. 2.36.  
 
Money received by the holder of the bill = Rs. (6000 - 120) 
    = Rs. 5880.  
 
 
Ex. 2. If the true discount on a certain sum due 6 months hence at 15% is Rs. 120, 
what is the banker's discount on the same sum for the same time and at the same 
rate? 
 
Sol.    B.G. = S.I. on T.D.  
          = Rs.(120 x 15 x 1/2 x 1/100) 
  = Rs. 9. 
(B.D.) - (T.D.) = Rs. 9. 
B.D. = Rs. (120 + 9) = Rs. 129. 
 
Ex. 3. The banker's discount on Rs. 1800 at 12% per annum is equal to the true 
discount on Rs. 1872 for the same time at the same rate. Find the time. 
 Sol. 
S.I. on Rs. 1800 = T.D. on Rs. 1872. 
P.W. of Rs. 1872 is Rs. 1800. 
Rs. 72 is S.I. on Rs. 1800 at 12%. 
Time =[(100 x 72)/ (12x1800)]year  
1/3year = 4 months. 
               
Ex. 4. The banker's discount and the true discount on a sum of money due 8 months 
hence are Rs. 120 and Rs. 110 respectively. Find the sum and the rate percent. 
 Sol. 
Sum =[( B.D.*T.D.)/(B.D.-T.D.)] 
= Rs.[(120x110)/(120-110)] 
= Rs. 1320. 
Since B.D. is S.I. on sum due, so S.I. on Rs. 1320 for 8 months is Rs. 120. 
Rate =[(100 x120)/( 1320 x 2/3)%  
= 13  7/11%. 
 
Ex. 5. The present worth of a bill due sometime hence is Rs. 1100 and the true 
discount on the bill is Rs. 110. Find the banker's discount and the banker's gain. 
Sol.     T.D. =?(P.W.*B.G) 
B.G. =(T.D.)2/ P.W.        
= Rs.[(110x110)/ 1100] 
= Rs. 11. 
B.D.= (T.D. + B.G.) = Rs. (110 + 11) = Rs. 121. 
 
Ex. 6. The banker's discount on Rs. 1650 due a certain time hence is Rs. 165. Find 
the true discount and the banker's gain. 
Sol.   
   Sum = [(B.D.xT.D.)/ (B.D.-T.D.)] 
   = [(B.D.xT.D.)/B.G.] 
T.D./B.G.  = Sum/ B.D.    
          =1650/165 
 =10/1 
 Thus, if B.G. is Re 1, T.D. = Rs. 10. 
If B.D.is Rs. ll, T.D.=Rs. 10.  
If B.D. is Rs. 165, T.D. = Rs. [(10/11)xl65] 
            =Rs.150 
 And, B.G. = Rs. (165 - 150) = Rs, 15. 
 
Ex. 7. What rate percent does a man get for his money when in discounting a bill 
due 10 months hence, he deducts 10%  of the amount of the bill? 
Solution: Let amount of the bill = Rs.100 
Money deducted =Rs.10 
Money received by the holder of the bill = Rs.100-10 = Rs.90 
SI on Rs.90 for 10 months = Rs.10 
Rate =[(100*10)/(90*10/12)%=13 1/3%

This section comprises of questions in which certain data regarding common 
disciplines as production over a period of a few years: imports, exports, 
incomes of employees in a factory, students applying for and qualifying a 
certain field of study etc. are given in the form of a table. The candidate is 
required to understand the given information and thereafter answer the given 
questions on the basis of comparative analysis of the data. 
Thus, here the data collected by the investigator are arranged in a systematic 
form in a table called the tabular form. In order to avoid some heads again 
and again, tables are made consisting of horizontal lines called rows and 
vertical lines called columns with distinctive heads, known as captions. Units 
of measurements are given with the captions.

 (a) 1 (b) 2 (c) 3 (d) None        (e) None of these 
6. In which subject is the overall percentage the best? 
 (a) History (b) Maths (c) Physics (d) Chemistry (e) Geography 
Sol. 1.. (e) : Aggregate marks obtained by Sajal 
 = [(90% of 150) + (60% of 130) + (70% of 120) + (70% of 100) + 
    (90% of 60)  + (70% of 40)] = 135 + 78 + 84 + 70 + 54 + 28 = 449. 
 2. (c) : Aggregate marks obtained by Tarun . 
= [(65% of 150) + (35% of 130) + (50% of 120) + (77% of 100) + (80% of 
60) + (80% of 40)] = 97.5 + 45.5 + 60 + 77 + 48 + 32 = 360. 
Total maximum marks (of all the six subjects) 
= (150 + 130 + 120 + 100 + 60 + 40) = 600. 
 
Overall percentage of Tarun = 360 x 100 % = 60%. 
 .              600 
3. (b) : Average marks obtained in Physics by all the seven students 
  
= 1 [(90% of 120) + (80% of 120) + (70% of 120) + (80% of 120) 
   7  
         + (85% of 120) + (65% of 120) + (50% of 120)]

    7         
  
=1 [520% of 120] = 89.14. 
  7  
4. (b) : From the table it is clear that Sajal and Rohit have 60% or more 
marks 
in each of the six subjects. 
           6. (b) : We shall find the overall percentage (for all the seven students) with 
respect to each subject. 
The overall percentage for any subject is equal to the average of percentages 
obtained by all the seven students since the maximum marks for any subject 
is the same for all the students. 
Therefore, overall percentage for: 
(i) Maths = [1(90+100+90+80+80+70+65)]% 
         7 
= [1(575)]% = 82.14%. 
       7 
(ii) Chemistry = [1(50 + 80 + 60 + 65 + 65 + 75 + 35)]% 
                               7 
= [1(430)]% = 61.43%. . 
    7 
(iii) Physics = [1(90 + 80 + 70 + 80 + 85 + 65 + 50)]% 
                       7 
                   =[1 (520)]% = 74.29%. 
 7 
(iv) Geography = [1(60 + 40 + 70 + 80 + 95 + 85 + 77)]% 
 7  
                            = [1 (507)}_ = 72.43%. 
 7 
(v) History = [1 (70 + 80 + 90+ 60 + 50 + 40 + 80)]% 
                        7             
                     =1 [(470)]% = 67.14%. 
 7 
(vi) Computer Science = [1/7 (80 + 70 + 70 + 60 + 90 + 60 + 80)]% 
  
= [1 (510)]% = 72.86%. 
 7  
Clearly; this. percentage is highest for Maths.

= 3480 million US $. 
Foreign exchange reserves in 1996-97 = 4320 million US $. . . 
Required Percentage =  x 100 % = 124.14% .. 125%. 
 3480 . 
 
5. (c) : Average foreign exchange reserves over the given period = 3480 million 
US $. 
The country had reserves above 3480 million US $ during the years 199293, 
1996-97 and 1997-98 i.e., for 3 years and below 3480 million US $ during the 
years 1991-92, 1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1998-99 i.e., for 5 years. 
Hence, required ratio = 3 : 5.

SOLN………………….. 
1.(d) total sales of branches B1,B3 and B5 for both the years (in thousand 
numbers)=(80+105)+(95+110)+(75+95)=560 
 
2(c) required percentage=[(70+80)/(95+110)*100]%=(150/205*100)%=73.17% 
 
3(b)average sales of all the six branches (in thousand numbers ) for the year 
2000=1/6*(80+75+95+85+75+70)=80 
 
4(e) required ratio=(75+65)/(85+95)=140/180=7/9 
 
5(e)average sales(in thousand numbers of branches B1,B3,and B6 in 2000= 
1/3*(80+95+70)=245/3 
        
       average sales(in thousand numbers of branches B1,B2,and B3 in 
2001=1/3*(105+65+110)=280/3 
 
  therefore  required percentage=[((245/3)/(280/3))*100]%=(245/280*100)%=87.5%

of company y the maximum? 
a.1996 
b.1997 
c.1998 
d.1999 
e.2000 
Sol: 1(b):required difference =  
                   [(45-25)*i,00,000]tons=20,00,000 tons 
 
2(c):average production of company x in the period 1998-
2000=[1/3*(25+50+40)]=(115/3) lakh tons 
 
average production of company y in the period 1998-2000 
[1/3*(35+40+50)]=(125/3) lakh tons 
 
therefore req ratio=(115/3)/(125/3)=115/125=23/25 
 
3(d):percentage increase in the production y from 1996-1999=[(40-
25)/25*100]%=(15/25*100)%=60% 
 
4(e):average production (in lakh tons)in five years for the three company’s are: 
for company x=[1/5*(30+45+25+50+40)]=190/5=38 
for company y=[1/5*(25+35+35+40+50)]=185/5=37 
for company z=[1/5*(35+40+45+35+35)]=190/5=38 
therefore the average production of maximum for both the company’s x and z 
 
5(a) : Percentage change (rise/fall)in the production of Company Y in comparison 
to the previous year, for different years are: 
For 1997 = [((32-25)/25)*100]% = 40% 
For 1998 = [((35-35)/25)*100]% = 0% 
For 1999 = [((40-35)/35)*100]% = 14.29% 
For 2000 = [((50-40)/40)*100]% = 25% 
 
Hence, the maximum percentage rise/fall in the production of company Y is for 
1997. 
   
6(a) : The percentages of production of company z to the production of company 
z for various years are: 
For 1996 = ((35/25)*100)%=140%; For 1997 = ((40/35)*100)% = 114.29% 
For 1998 = ((45/35)*100)%=128.57%; For 1999 = ((35/40)*100)%=87.5% 
For 2000 = ((35/50)*100)%=70% 
  
Clearly, this percentage is highest for 1996.

goods? 
(a)1996 (b) 1997 (c) 1998 (d) 1999 (e) 2000 
3.Whatwas the difference between the average amount invested in Raw Materials 
during the given period and the average value of sales of finished goods during this 
period? 
(a)Rs. 62.5 lakhs    (b) Rs. 68.5 lakhs      (c) Rs. 71.5 lakhs 
(d)Rs.77.51akhs      (e) Rs. 83.5 lakhs 
 
4. The value of sales of finished goods in 1999 was approximately what percent 
of the average amount invested in Raw Materials in the years 1997,1998 and 
1999? 
(a) 33%            (b) 37%                   (c) 45%                 (d) 49%                   (e) 53% 
 
5. The maximum difference between the amount invested in Raw Materials and 
the value of sales of finished goods was during the year: 
(a) 1995            (b) 1996                  (c) 1997                 (d) 1998                   (e) 
1999 
 
Sol.  1. (a) : The percentage increase in the amount invested in raw-materials as 
compared to the previous year, for different years are: 
               For 1996 = [((225-120)/120)*100]% = 87.5% 
               For 1997 = [((375-225)/225)*100]% = 66.67% 
               For 1998 = [((525-330)/330)*100]% = 59.09% 
               For 2000 there is a decrease. 
        2.(b)The percentage change in the amount invested in raw-materials and in the 
value of sales of finished goods for different years are:  
               ?
year Percentage change in amount 
invested in raw-materials 
Percentage change in value of sales of 
finished goods 
1996 [((225-120)/120)*100]% = 87.5% [((300-200)/200)*100]% = 50% 
1997 [((375-225)/225)*100]% = 66.7% [((500-300)/300)*100]% = 66.67% 
1998 [((525-330)/330)*100]% = -12% [((400-500)/500)*100]% = -20% 
1999 [((525-330)/330)*100]% = 59.09% [((600-400)/400)*100]% = 50% 
2000   [((420-525)/525)*100]% = -20% [((460-600)/600)*100]% = -23.33% 
 
Thus the percentage difference is same during the year 1997. 
 
3. (d) : Required difference =  Rs. [(1/6)*(200+300+500+400+600+460) 
- (1/6)*(120+225+375+330+525+420)] lakhs 
= Rs. [(2460/6)-(1995/6)] lakhs = Rs.(410-332.5)lakhs = 77.5 lakhs. 
 
4. (d) : Required percentage = [(600/(375+300+525))*100]% = 48.78% ? 49% 
 
5. (c) : The difference between the amount invested in raw-material and the value 
of sales of finished goods for various years are : 
   For 1995 = Rs.(200-120)lakhs = Rs. 80 lakhs 
   For 1996 = Rs.(200-225)lakhs = Rs. 75 lakhs 
   For 1997 = Rs. (500-375)lakhs = Rs. 125 lakhs 
   For 1998 = Rs. (400-330)lakhs = Rs. 70 lakhs. 
   For 1999 = Rs. (600-525)lakhs = Rs. 75 lakhs 
   For 2000 = Rs. (460-420)lakhs = Rs. 40 lakhs. 
 Clearly, maximum difference was during 1997

38. PIE-CHARTS 
 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
The pie-chart or a pie-graph is a method of representing a given numerical data in the form of 
sectors of a circle. 
The sectors of the circle are constructed in such a way that the area of each sector is proportional 
to the corresponding value of the component of the data. 
From geometry, we know that the area of a circle is proportional to the central angle. 
So, the central angle of each sector must be proportional to the corresponding value of the 
component. 
Since the sum of all the central angle is 360°, we have            
                                                 Value of the component           ?    
Central angle of the component =        ------------------------ * 360                                              
               Total value      
 
SOLVED EXAMPLES 
 
The procedure of solving problems based on pie-charts will be clear from the following solved 
examples. 
 
Example 1. The following pie-chart shows the sources of funds to be collected by the National 
Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for its Phase II projects. Study the pie-chart and answer 
the questions that follow. 
                    
                     SOURCES OF FUNDS TO BE ARRANGED BY  NHAI 
                        FOR PHASE II PROJECTS (IN CRORES RS.) 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
Total funds to be arranged for Projects (Phase II) =Rs.57,600 crores. 
1. Near about 20% of the funds are to be arranged through: 
(a) SPVS                     (b) External Assistance 
(c) Annuity   (d) Market Borrowing 
 
2. The central angle corresponding to Market Borrowing is: 
(a) 52°    (b) 137.8° 
(c) 187.2°   (d) 192.4° 
 
3. The approximate ratio of the funds to be arranged through Toll and that through Market 
Borrowing is: 
(a) 2:9    (b) 1:6 
(c) 3:11   (d) 2:5 
 
4. If  NHAI could receive a total of Rs. 9695 crores as External Assistance, by what percent 
(approximately) should it increase the Market Borrowings to arrange for the shortage of funds ? 
(a) 4.5%   (b) 7.5% 
(c) 6%    (d) 8% 
 
5.If the toll is to be collected through an outsourced agency by allowing a maximum 10% 
commission, how much amount should be permitted to be collected by the outsourced agency, so 
that the project is supported with Rs. 4910 crores ? 
(a) Rs.6213 crores  (b) Rs. 5827 crores 
(c) Rs. 5401 crores  (d) Rs. 5216 crores 
            
 
SOLUTION 
 
1. (b): 20% of the total funds to be arranged = Rs.(20% of 57600) crores 
                                                                       = Rs.11520 crores Rs.11486 crores. 
 
2. (c):Central angle corresponding to Market Borrowing =   29952 
                                                                                                --------  * 360? 
                                                                                                57600 
                                                                                          = 187.2?

         Required ratio =  ------- = ---- = ---- 
                                     29952    6.1      6    
 
4. (c):Shortage of funds arranged through External Assistance 
                              =Rs.(11486-9695) crores =Rs. 1791 crores. 
        therefore, Increase required in Market Borrowings =Rs. 1791 crores. 
         
             1791      
     Percentage increase required =     -------- * 100   % =  5.98 % = 6% 
                                                            29952 
5. (c):Amount permitted  = (Funds required from Toll for projects of Phase II ) + 
        (10 % of these funds)   
     =Rs. 4910 crores + Rs. (10% of 4910) crores  
    =Rs. (4910 + 491) crores = Rs. 5401 crores.

(i)   Wheat,Barley and jowar = (72?+36?+18?)=126? 
(ii)  Rice,Wheat and Jowar = (72?+72?+18?)=162? 
(iii) Rice,Wheat and Barley = (72?+72?+36?)=180? 
(iv)Bajra,Maize and Rice = (18?+45?+72?) = 135?   
Clearly:(iii) is the required combination. 
 
2.(a):   The area under any of the food crops is proportional to the angle corresponding to that crop. 
Let the area under the rice production be x million acres. 
Then, 18:72 = 1.5:x ? x=(72*15/18)=6 
Thus, the area under rice production be = 6 million acres. 
 
3.(b): Let the total production of barley be T tones and let Z acres of land be put under barley    
production. 
Then, the total production of wheat =(6T) tones. 
Also,area under wheat production = (2Z) acres. 
 
?Area Under Wheat Production     72?      
   ------------------------------------- = ----   =2   
            Area Under Barley Production    36?      
            And therefore,Area under wheat = 2*Area under Barley = (2Z)acres 
 
Now, yield per acre for wheat = (6T/2Z) tones/acre = (3T/Z) tones/acre 
And yield per acre for barley = (T/Z) tones/acre. 
                                              3T/Z  
             ?Required ratio  = -------- = 3:1.   
                                               T/Z 
        4. (b):Let Z acres of land be put under barley production. 
                                               Area Under Rice Production         72 ? 
                              Then,       -----------------------------------   =   ----  =  2. 
                                               Area Under Barley Production       36?  
?Area under rice production = 2 * area under barley production = (2Z) acres. 
Now,if p tones be the yield per acre of barley then ,yield per acre of rice 
                        =(p+50% of p) tones =(3/2 p) tones. 
?Total production of rice = (yield per acre) * (area under production) 
                                          =  (3/2 p)*2Z=(3pZ) tones. 
And,Total production of barley = (pz) tones. 
?Percentage production of barley to that rice = (pZ/3pZ *100)%= 33 1/3% . 
 
5.(b): Initially,let  t  be the total area under considerations. 
The area under wheat production initially was =(72/360 * t)acres  =  (t/5)acres. 
Now,if the total area under consideration be increased by 5%, 
then the new value of the total area= (105/100 t) acres. 
Also,if the area under wheat production be increased by 12%, 
                                                                       t                      t 
then the new value of area under wheat =     --  +(12% of   --)   acres = (112t/500)acres. 
                                                                       5                     5 
 ?Central angle corresponding to wheat in the pie-chart

5.(a) : Let the total population of all the seven villages in 1997 be N. 
           Then,population of village R in 1997 = 16% of N =  16/ 100 N 
            And population of village Z in 1997 = 11% of N =11/100 N

Ex. 1. In a school the periodical examination are held every second month. In a session 
during Apr. 2001 – Mar. 2002, a student of Class IX appeared for each of the periodical 
exams. The aggregate marks obtained by him in each periodical exam are represented in the 
line-graph given below. Study the graph and answer the questions based on it.   
    (S.B.I.P.O 2003)  
 
       MARKS OBTAINED BY A STUDENT IN SIX PERIODICAL EXAMS HELD IN                    
          EVERY TWO MONTHS DURING THE YEAR IN THE SESSION 2001-02   
 
 
               Maximum Total Marks In each Periodical Exam = 500

2. What are the average marks obtained by the student in all the periodical exams of 
during the session. 
 (a) 373        (b) 379           (c) 381       (d) 385           (e) 389 
3. what is the percentage of marks obtained by the student in the periodical exams of 
Aug. 01 and Oct. 01 taken together? 
             (a) 73.25% (b) 75.5%       (c) 77%     (d) 78.75%     (e) 79.5% 
4. In which periodical exams there is a fall in percentage of marks as compared to the 
previous periodical exams? 
             (a) None      (b) Jun. 01      (c) Oct. 01  (d) Feb. 01   (e) None of these 
5. In which periodical exams did the student obtain the highest percentage increase in 
marks over the previous periodical exams? 
 (a) Jun. 01    (b) Aug. 01   (c) Oct. 01 (d) Dec. 01   (e) Feb. 02 
 
Sol. Here it is clear from the graph that the student obtained 360, 365, 370, 385, 400 and 405 
marks in periodical exams held in Apr. 01, Jun. 01, Aug. 01, Oct. 01, Dec. 01 and  Feb. 02 
respectively. 
 
1. (b) : Required percentage = [(405/360)*100] % = 112.5 % 
2. (c) : Average marks obtained in all the periodical exams. 
                = (1/6)*[360+370+385+400+404] = 380.83 ? 381. 
3. (d) : Required percentage = [(370+385)/(500+500) * 100] % = [(755/1000)*100]% =75.5% 
4. (a) : As is clear from graph, the total marks obtained in periodical exams, go on increasing. 
Since, the maximum marks for all the periodical exams are same , it implies that the 
percentage of marks also goes on increasing. Thus, in none of the periodical exams, there is 
a fall  in percentage of marks compared to the previous exam. 
5. (c) : Percentage increases in marks in various periodical exams compared to the previous 
exams are: 
For Jun. 01 = [(365-360)/360 * 100 ] % = 1.39 % 
For Aug. 01 = [(370-365)/365 * 100 ] % = 1.37 % 
For Oct. 01 = [(385-370)/370 * 100 ] % = 4.05% 
For Dec. 01 = [(400-385)/385 * 100 ] % = 3.90 % 
For Feb. 02 = [(405-400)/400 * 100 ] % = 1.25 % 
 
Ex. 2. The following line- graph the ratio of the amounts of imports by a Company to the 
amount of exports from that Company over the period from 1995 to 2001. The questions 
given below are based on this graph.  (S.B.I.P.O 2001) 
 
                 
 
                            Ratio of value of Import to Export by a Company over the Years 
 
 
 
 
1. In how many of the given years were the exports more than the imports? 
a. 1  b. 2              c. 3             d. 4 
 
2.The imports were minimum proportionate to the exports of the Company in the year: 
  a..1995 b.1996  c.1997  d.2001 
 
3.If the imports of the Company in 1996 was Rs.272 crores, the exports from the 
Company in 1996 was: 
a. Rs.370 crores  b.Rs.320 crores  c.Rs.280 crores 
d.Rs.275 crores e.Rs.264 crores 
 
4.What was the percentage increase in imports from 1997 to 1998? 
a. 72 b.56 c.28 d.None of these e.Data inadequate 
 
5.If the imports in 1998 was Rs.250 crores and the total exports in the years 1998 and 
1999 together was Rs.500 crores, then the imports in 1999 was: 
a.Rs.250 crores b.Rs.300 crores c.Rs 357 crores 
d.Rs 420 crores e.None of these 
 
Sol: 1.  d : The exports are more than the imports implies that the ratio of value of imports to 
exports is less than 1. 
Now, this ratio is less than 1 in the years 1995,1996,1997 and 2000. 
Thus, there are four such years. 
 
2.   c:  The imports are minimum proportionate to the exports implies that the ratio of the    
value of imports to exports has the minimum value. 
Now, this ratio has a minimum value of 0.35 in 1997, i.e., the imports are minimum 
proportionate to the exports in 1997. 
 
3.   b:  Ratio of imports to exports in the years 1996=0.85. 
Let the exports in 1996=Rs.320 crores. 
Then,272/x =0.85  implies x=272/.85 = 320. 
 
Exports in 1996 = Rs.320 crores. 
4. e: The graph gives  only the ratio of imports to exports for different years. To find the 
percentage increase in imports from 1997 to 1998, we require more details such as the 
value of imports or exports during these years. Hence, the data is inadequate to answer 
this question. 
 
5.    d: The ratio of imports to exports for the years 1998 and 1999 are 1.25 and 1.40 
respectively. 
Let the exports in the year 1998 = Rs. x crores 
Then, the exports in the year 1999=Rs(500-x) crores. 
1.25=250/x implies x=250/1.25=200 
Thus the exports in the year 1999=Rs. (500-200)crores=Rs.300 crores 
Let the imports in the year 1999=Rs. y crores 
Then, 1.4=y/300 implies y=(300*1.4)=420. 
Imports in  the year 1999=Rs.420 crores.

a.119333 b.113666 c.112778 d.111223 e. None of these 
 
4.In which of the following years, the difference between the productions of Companies X 
and Y was the maximum among the given years? 
a.1997  b.1998  c.1999  d.2000  e.2001 
 
5.The production of Company Y in 2000 was approximately what percent of the production 
of Company X in the same year? 
a.173.  b.164  c.132  d.97  e.61 
 
Sol:  From the line-graph it is clear that the productions of Company X in the years 
1997,1998,1999,2000,2001 and 2002 are 119000,99000,141000,78000,120000and 159000 
respectively and those of Company Y are 139000,120000,100000,128000,107000 and 148000 
respectively. 
 
     1. (c) :   Total production of Company X from 1997 to 2002                              
       = 119000+99000+141000+78000+120000+159000 = 716000 
              and total production of Company Y from 1997 to 2002  
                   =139000+120000+100000+128000+107000+148000=742000                                              
               Difference=742000-716000=26000. 
 
2. (d) : Require difference  = 128000-107000 = 21000. 
3. (a) : Average number of vehicles manufactured by Company X 
               = (91/6)* (119000 + 99000 + 141000 + 78000 + 120000 + 159000) = 119333. 
 
4. (d) : The difference between the production of Companies X and Y in various years are. 
              For 1997 = (139000 – 119000) = 20000; 
              For 1998 = (120000 – 99000) = 21000; 
              For 1999 = (141000 – 100000) = 41000; 
              For 2000 = (128000 – 78000) = 50000; 
              For 2001 = (120000 – 107000) = 13000; 
              For 2003 = (159000 – 148000) = 11000; 
              Clearly, maximum difference was in 2000. 
 
 
5. (b) : Required   percentage = [( 128000/78000)* 100] % = 164 %. 
 
Ex. 4. The following line-graph gives the percent profit earned by two Companies X and Y  
during the period 1996 – 2001. Study the line – graph and answer the questions that are 
based on on it.  
 
      Percentage Profit Earned by Two Companies X and Y over the Given years 
  % profit/ loss = [(Income – Expenditure) / Expenditure] * 100 
 
 
 
 
 
1. If the expenditure of Company Y in 1997 was Rs. 220 crores, what was its income in 
1997? 
(a). Rs. 312 crores   (b). Rs. 297 crores  (c) Rs. 283 crores (d) Rs. 275 crores (e)Rs.261 crores 
 
2.If the incomes of the two companies were equal in 1999,then what was the ratio of 
expenditure of Company X to that of company Y in 1999 ? 
(a) 6:5  (b) 5:6  (c) 11:6  (d) 16:15  (e) 15:16  
 
3.The incomes of the companies X and Y in 2000 were in the ratio of 3:4 
respectively.What was the respective ratio of their expenditures in 2000? 
(a) 7:22  (b) 14:19  (c) 15:22  (d)27:35   (e) 33:40 
 
4.If the expenditure ofcompanies X and Y in 1996 were equal and the total income of the 
two companies in 1996 was Rs.342 crores, what was the total profit of the twocompanies 
together in 1996 ? (Profit = Income – Expenditure) 
(a) Rs.240crores  (b) Rs.171crores  (c) Rs.120crores  (d) Rs.102crores  (e)None of these. 
 
5.The expenditure ofcompany X in the year 1998 was Rs.200 crores and the income 
Company X in 1998 was the same as its expenditure in 2001 was: 
(a) Rs.465crores  (b)Rs.385crores   (c)Rs.295crores    (d)Rs.255crores 
 
Sol.1.(b) : Profit percent ofcompany Y in 1997=35. 
Let the income of company Y in 1997 be Rs.x crores  
Then,35 = x-220  X  100  ? x =297 
                   220 
?Income of company Yin 1997 = Rs.297crores 
 
     2.(d): Let the incomes of the twocompanies X and Yin 1999 be Rs.x and let the 
Expenditures of companies X and Y in 1999 be E1 and E2 respectively  
            Then, for Company X we have: 
 
50=  x-E1   x  100      ?    50    = x     -1       ?  x = 150  E1 
          E1                            100     E1 100 
 
Also, for the Company Y we have: 
 
60 =  x-E2   *100 =>60  = x  -1 =>x =160 E2 
           E2             100     E2              100  
From (i) and (ii),we get 
150 E1 =160 E2  =>E1=160 =16(Required ratio) 
100         100           E2  150    15 
 
3.(c):Let the incomes in 2000 of companies X and Y be 3x and 4x respectively.And let 
the expenditure in 2000 of  companies X and Y be E1 and E2 respectively. 
Then, for company X we have: 
65=3x-E1 *100  =>65 = 3x   -1 =>E1=3x  *(100) 
        E1                  100   E1                            165 
For company Y we have: 
50 =4x-E2  *100 => 50 = 4x  -1 =>E2 = 4x* (100) 
         E2                   100   E2                            150 
From (i)and(ii) we get: 
E1 = 3x*(100/165) =3* 150 =15(Required ratio) 
E2    4x*(100/150)    4*165    22 
 
 
4.(d):Let the expenditures of each of the Companies X and Y in 1996 be 
Rs.xcrores.And let the income of Company X in 1996 be Rs.zcrores so that the income 
of Company Y in 1996 =Rs.(342-z)crores. 
Then,for company X we have: 
40= z-x *100 => 40 = z   -1 => x  = 100z 
         x                100   x                    140 
Also for company Y we have: 
45= (342-z)-x   *100 => 45 =  (342-z)  -1  =>x = (342 –z)* 100 
            x                         100        x                              145 
From(i)and (ii) we get: 
100z =  (342-z) *100 =>z = 168 
140 145 
 
Substituting z=168 in (i),we get: x=120 
? Total expenditure of companies X and Y in 1996=2x=Rs.240crores. 
      Total income of companies X and Y in 1996=Rs.342 crores. 
?Total profit =Rs.(342-240)crores =Rs.102 crores 
 
 
5.(a): Let the income of company X in 1998 be Rs.x crores. 
   Then,55= x-200  *100 => x = 310. 
                                      200 
?Expenditure of Company X in 2001= Income of company X in 1998 = Rs.310crores 
Let  the income of company X in 2001 be Rs.z crores 
Then,50 = z-310  *100 =>z = 465. 
                   310 
?Income of company X in 2001 = Rs.465 crores.

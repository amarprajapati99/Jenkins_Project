WI..Numeral : In Hindu Arabic system, we use ten symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
)called digits to represent any number. 
= A group of digits, denoting a number is called a numeral. 
9 We represent a number, say 689745132 as shown below :

and thirty-two'.  
;II  Place Value or Local Value of a Digit in a Numeral : 
In the above numeral : 
GPlace value of 2 is (2 x 1) = 2; Place value of 3 is (3 x 10) = 30;  
1Place value of 1 is (1 x 100) = 100 and so on. 
+Place value of 6 is 6 x 108 = 600000000  
]III.Face Value : The face value of a digit in a numeral is the value of the   digit itself 
Xat whatever place it may be. In the above numeral, the face value of 2 is 2; the face 
value of 3 is 3 and so on. 
IV.TYPES OF NUMBERS 
N1.Natural Numbers : Counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,..... are called natural 
numbers. 
R2.Whole Numbers : All counting numbers together with zero form the set of whole 
numbers. Thus, 
I        (i) 0 is the only whole number which is not a natural number.  
7        (ii) Every natural number is a whole number. 
N3.Integers : All natural numbers, 0 and negatives of counting numbers i.e., 
P{‚Ä¶, - 3 , - 2 , - 1 ,  0, 1, 2, 3,‚Ä¶..} together form the set of integers. 
S(i) Positive Integers : {1, 2, 3, 4, ‚Ä¶..} is the set of all positive integers. 
V(ii) Negative Integers : {- 1, - 2, - 3,‚Ä¶..} is the set of all negative integers. 
K(iii) Non-Positive and Non-Negative Integers : 0 is neither positive nor 
Unegative. So, {0, 1, 2, 3,‚Ä¶.} represents the set of non-negative integers, while 
L{0, - 1 , - 2 , - 3 , ‚Ä¶..} represents the set of non-positive integers. 
Y4.  Even Numbers : A number divisible by 2 is called an even number, e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 
10, etc. 
[5.  Odd Numbers : A number not divisible by 2 is called an odd number. e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 
9, 11, etc. 
Z6.  Prime Numbers : A number greater than 1 is called a prime number, if it has exactly 
/two factors, namely 1 and the number itself. 
SPrime numbers upto 100 are : 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 
/47,  53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. 
YPrime numbers Greater than 100 : Let p be a given number greater than 100. To find out 
<whether it is prime or not, we use the following method : 
\Find a whole number nearly greater than the square root of p. Let k > *jp. Test whether p 
]is divisible by any prime number less than k. If yes, then p is not prime. Otherwise, p is 
	prime. 
Me.g,,We have to find whether 191 is a prime number or not. Now, 14 > V191. 
5Prime numbers less than 14 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. 
B191 is not divisible by any of them. So, 191 is a prime number. 
Q7.Composite Numbers : Numbers greater than 1 which are not prime, are known as 
/composite numbers, e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. 
2Note :    (i) 1 is neither prime nor composite. 
2(ii) 2 is the only even number which is prime.  
6(iii) There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100. 
\8.  Co-primes : Two numbers a and b are said to be co-primes, if their H.C.F. is 1. e.g., 
7(2, 3), (4, 5), (7, 9), (8, 11), etc. are co-primes, 
V.TESTS OF DIVISIBILITY 
c1.  Divisibility By 2 : A number is divisible by 2, if its unit's digit is any of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. 
3Ex. 84932 is divisible by 2, while 65935 is not. 
b2.  Divisibility By 3 : A number is divisible by 3, if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. 
]Ex.592482 is divisible by 3, since sum of its digits = (5 + 9 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 2) = 30, which 
is divisible by 3. 
\But, 864329 is not divisible by 3, since sum of its digits =(8 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 9) = 32, 
which is not divisible by 3. 
[3.  Divisibility By 4 : A number is divisible by 4, if the number formed by the last two 
digits is divisible by 4. 
REx. 892648 is divisible by 4, since the number formed by the last two digits is 
 48,  which is divisible by 4. 
\But, 749282 is not divisible by 4, since the number formed by the last tv/o digits is 82, 
which is not divisible by 4. 
b4.  Divisibility By 5 : A number is divisible by 5, if its unit's digit is either 0 or 5. Thus, 
E20820 and 50345 are divisible by 5, while 30934 and 40946 are not. 
^5.  Divisibility By 6 : A number is divisible by 6, if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Ex. 
.The number 35256 is clearly divisible by 2. 
XSum of its digits = (3 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 6) = 21, which is divisible by 3. Thus, 35256 is 
?divisible by 2 as well as 3. Hence, 35256 is divisible by 6. 
X6.   Divisibility By 8 : A number is divisible by 8, if the number formed by the last 
6three digits of the given number is divisible by 8. 
^Ex. 953360 is divisible by 8, since the number formed by last three digits is 360, which is 
divisible by 8. 
ZBut, 529418 is not divisible by 8, since the number formed by last three digits is 418, 
which is not divisible by 8. 
]7.   Divisibility By 9 : A number is divisible by 9, if the sum of its digits is divisible 
by 9. 
XEx. 60732 is divisible by 9, since sum of digits * (6 + 0 + 7 + 3 + 2) = 18, which is 
divisible by 9. 
]But, 68956 is not divisible by 9, since sum of digits = (6 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 6) = 34, which is 
not divisible by 9. 
L8.   Divisibility By 10 : A number is divisible by 10, if it ends with 0. 
<Ex. 96410, 10480 are divisible by 10, while 96375 is not. 
]9.   Divisibility By 11 : A number is divisible by 11, if the difference of the sum of its 
Ydigits at odd places and the sum of its digits at even places, is either 0 or a number 
divisible by 11. 
5Ex. The number 4832718 is divisible by 11, since : 
A(sum of digits at odd places) - (sum of digits at even places) 
@(8 + 7 + 3 + 4) - (1 + 2 + 8) = 11, which is divisible by 11. 
Z10.  Divisibility By 12 ; A number is divisible by 12, if it is divisible by both 4 and 
3. 
!Ex. Consider the number 34632. 
L(i) The number formed by last two digits is 32, which is divisible by 4,  
Y(ii) Sum of digits = (3 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 2) = 18, which is divisible by 3. Thus, 34632 is 
@divisible by 4 as well as 3. Hence, 34632 is divisible by 12. 
`11.   Divisibility By 14 : A number is divisible by 14, if it is divisible by 2 as well as 7. 
]12.  Divisibility By 15 : A number is divisible by 15, if it is divisible by both 3 and 5. 
\13.  Divisibility By 16 : A number is divisible by 16, if the number formed by the last4  
digits is divisible by 16. 
ZEx.7957536 is divisible by 16, since the number formed by the last four digits is 7536, 
which is divisible by 16. 
`14.  Divisibility By 24 : A given number is divisible by 24, if it is divisible by both3  and 
8. 
Z15.  Divisibility By 40 : A given number is divisible by 40, if it is divisible by both 
5  and 8. 
`16.  Divisibility By 80 : A given number is divisible by 80, if it is divisible by both 5 and 
16. 
[Note : If a number is divisible by p as well as q, where p and q are co-primes, then the 
#given number is divisible by pq. 
TIf p arid q are not co-primes, then the given number need not be divisible by pq, 
-even when it is divisible by both p and q. 
TEx. 36 is divisible by both 4 and 6, but it is not divisible by (4x6) = 24, since 
4  and 6 are not co-primes.

+VI   MULTIPLICATION BY SHORT CUT METHODS 
+1.  Multiplication By Distributive Law : 
A(i) a x (b + c) = a x b + a x c    (ii) ax(b-c) = a x b-a x c. 
3Ex.   (i) 567958 x 99999 = 567958 x (100000 - 1) 
T= 567958 x 100000 - 567958 x 1 = (56795800000 - 567958) = 56795232042. (ii) 978 x 
=184 + 978 x 816 = 978 x (184 + 816) = 978 x 1000 = 978000. 
[2.  Multiplication of a Number By 5n :  Put n zeros to the right of the multiplicand and 
$divide the number so formed by 2n

X. PROGRESSION 
WA succession of numbers formed and arranged in a definite order according to certain 
*definite rule, is called a progression. 
T1. Arithmetic Progression (A.P.) : If each term of a progression differs from its 
Rpreceding term by a constant, then such a progression is called an arithmetical 
Tprogression. This constant difference is called the common difference of the A.P. 
ZAn A.P. with first term a and common difference d is given by a, (a + d), (a + 2d),(a + 
3d),..... 
9The nth term of this A.P. is given by Tn =a (n - 1) d. 
"The sum of n terms of this A.P. 
>Sn = n/2 [2a + (n - 1) d] = n/2   (first term + last term).

 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
\I.  Factors and Multiples : If a number a divides another number b exactly, we say that a 
?is a factor of b. In this case, b is called a multiple of a. 
LII. Highest Common Factor (H.C.F.) or Greatest Common Measure (G.C.M.) or 
RGreatest Common Divisor (G.C.D.): The H.C.F. of two or more than two numbers is 
:the greatest number that divides each of them exactly.  
M   There are two methods of finding the H.C.F. of a given set of numbers : 
R1.  Factorization Method : Express each one of the given numbers as the product 
Tof prime factors.The product of least powers of common prime factors gives H.C.F. 
P2.  Division Method: Suppose we have to find the H.C.F. of two given numbers. 
PDivide the larger   number by the smaller one. Now, divide the divisor by the 
Rremainder. Repeat the process of dividing the preceding number by the remainder 
Ulast obtained till zero is obtained as remainder. The last divisor is the required 
H.C.F.   
LFinding the H.C.F. of more than two numbers : Suppose we have to find the 
OH.C.F. of three numbers. Then, H.C.F. of [(H.C.F. of any two) and (the third 
4number)] gives the H.C.F. of three given numbers. 
ESimilarly, the H.C.F. of more than three numbers may be obtained.  
XIII.  Least Common Multiple (L.C.M.) : The least number which is exactly divisible by 
7each one of the given numbers is called their L.C.M. 
L1.  Factorization Method of Finding L.C.M.: Resolve each one of the given 
Rnumbers into a product of prime factors. Then, L.C.M. is the product of highest 
powers of all the factors, 
C2.  Common Division Method {Short-cut Method) of Finding L.C.M.: 
LArrange the given numbers in a row in any order. Divide by a number which 
Rdivides exactly at least two of the given numbers and carry forward the numbers 
Swhich are not divisible. Repeat the above process till no two of the numbers are 
Mdivisible by the same number except 1. The product of the divisors and the 
Aundivided numbers is the required L.C.M. of the given numbers, 
BIV. Product of two numbers =Product of their H.C.F. and L.C.M.  
LV. Co-primes: Two numbers are said to be co-primes if their H.C.F. is 1.  
&VI. H.C.F. and L.C.M. of Fractions: 
N1.H C F= H.C.F. of Numerators         2.L C M =      L.C.M  of Numerators__ 
O     L.C.M. of Denominators                           H.C.F. of Denominators 
OVII. H.C.F. and L.C.M. of Decimal Fractions: In given numbers, make the same 
Xnumber of decimal places by annexing zeros in some numbers, if necessary. Considering 
Ythese numbers without decimal point, find H.C.F. or L.C.M. as the case may be. Now, in 
Ythe result, mark off as many decimal places as are there in each of the given numbers. 
RVIII. Comparison of Fractions: Find the L.C.M. of the denominators of the given 
Zfractions. Convert each of the fractions into an equivalent fraction with L.C.M. as the 
Udenominator, by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same number. 
FThe resultant fraction with the greatest numerator is the greatest.

3. DECIMAL FRACTIONS 
IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
cI.    Decimal Fractions : Fractions in which denominators are powers of 10 are known as decimal  
fractions.    
C                   Thus ,1/10=1 tenth=.1;1/100=1 hundredth =.01; 
L                    99/100=99 hundreths=.99;7/1000=7 thousandths=.007,etc 
aII.  Conversion of a Decimal Into Vulgar Fraction : Put 1 in the denominator under the decimal 
apoint and annex with it as many zeros as is the number of digits after the decimal point. Now, 
Hremove the decimal point and reduce the fraction to its lowest terms. 
 
1Thus, 0.25=25/100=1/4;2.008=2008/1000=251/125. 
    
`III.  1.  Annexing zeros to the extreme right of a decimal fraction does not change its value 
-            Thus, 0.8 = 0.80 = 0.800, etc. 
 
T2.  If numerator and denominator of a fraction contain the same number of decimal 
0     places, then we remove the decimal sign. 
J         Thus,   1.84/2.99 = 184/299 = 8/13;    0.365/0.584 = 365/584=5 
 
)IV.  Operations on Decimal Fractions : 
 
N1. Addition and Subtraction of Decimal Fractions : The given numbers are so 
Qplaced under each other that the decimal points lie in one column. The numbers 
?so arranged can now be added or subtracted in the usual way. 
 
O2. Multiplication of a Decimal Fraction By a Power of 10 : Shift the decimal 
>point to the right by as many places as is the power of 10. 
EThus, 5.9632 x 100 = 596,32; 0.073 x 10000 = 0.0730 x 10000 = 730. 
 
Q3.Multiplication of Decimal Fractions : Multiply the given numbers considering 
Sthem without the decimal point. Now, in the product, the decimal point is marked 
Qoff to obtain as many places of decimal as is the sum of the number of decimal 
places in the given numbers. 
PSuppose we have to find the product (.2 x .02 x .002). Now, 2x2x2 = 8. Sum of 
?decimal places = (1 + 2 + 3) = 6. .2 x .02 x .002 = .000008. 
 
H4.Dividing a Decimal Fraction By a Counting Number : Divide the given 
Nnumber without considering the decimal point, by the given counting number. 
SNow, in the quotient, put the decimal point to give as many places of decimal as 
there are in the dividend. 
\Suppose we have to find the quotient (0.0204 + 17). Now, 204 ^ 17 = 12. Dividend contains 
14 places of decimal. So, 0.0204 + 17 = 0.0012. 
 
 
\5. Dividing a Decimal Fraction By a Decimal Fraction : Multiply both the dividend and the 
[divisor by a suitable power of 10 to make divisor a whole number. Now, proceed as above. 
GThus, 0.00066/0.11 = (0.00066*100)/(0.11*100) = (0.066/11) = 0.006V  
 
ZV.  Comparison of Fractions : Suppose some fractions are to be arranged in ascending or 
ddescending order of magnitude. Then, convert each one of the given fractions in the decimal form, 
 and arrange them accordingly. 
 
TSuppose, we have to arrange the fractions  3/5, 6/7 and 7/9  in descending order. 
  
/    now, 3/5=0.6,6/7 = 0.857,7/9 = 0.777.... 
 
1     since  0.857>0.777...>0.6, so 6/7>7/9>3/5 
 
]VI. Recurring Decimal : If in a decimal fraction, a figure or a set of figures is repeated 
Bcontinuously, then such a number is called a recurring decimal. 
gIn a recurring decimal, if a single figure is repeated, then it is expressed by putting a dot on it. 
OIf a set of figures is repeated, it is expressed by putting a bar on the set 
               ______  
EThus 1/3 = 0.3333‚Ä¶.= 0.3;  22 /7 = 3.142857142857.....= 3.142857 
^Pure Recurring Decimal: A decimal fraction in which all the figures after the decimal point 
4are repeated, is called a pure recurring decimal. 
 
XConverting a Pure Recurring Decimal Into Vulgar Fraction : Write the repeated figures 
[only once in the numerator and take as many nines in the denominator as is the number of 
repeating figures. 
 
9thus ,0.5 = 5/9;  0.53 = 53/59  ;0.067 = 67/999;etc... 
 
 
[Mixed Recurring Decimal: A decimal fraction in which some figures do not repeat and some 
=of them are repeated, is called a mixed recurring decimal. 
e.g., 0.17333 . = 0.173. 
 
YConverting a Mixed Recurring Decimal Into Vulgar Fraction : In the numerator, take the 
^difference between the number formed by all the digits after decimal point (taking repeated 
^digits only once) and that formed by the digits which are not repeated, In the denominator, 
\take the number formed by as many nines as there are repeating digits followed by as many 
2zeros as is the number of non-repeating digits. 
 
+Thus 0.16 = (16-1) / 90 =  15/19 =  1/6; 
    ____

4. SIMPLIFICATION 
 
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS 
 
`I. ‚ÄôBODMAS‚ÄôRule: This rule depicts the correct sequence in which the operations are to be 
>executed,so as to find out the value of a given expression. 
 
ãHere, ‚ÄòB‚Äô stands for ‚Äôbracket‚Äô ,‚ÄôO‚Äôfor ‚Äòof‚Äô , ‚ÄòD‚Äô for‚Äô  division‚Äô  and ‚ÄòM‚Äô for ‚Äòmultiplication‚Äô, ‚ÄòA‚Äô 
8for ‚Äòaddition‚Äô and ‚ÄòS‚Äô for ‚Äòsubtraction‚Äô. 
aThus, in simplifying an expression, first of all the brackets must be removed, strictly in the 
order(), {} and []. 
 
[After removing the brackets, we must use the following operations strictly in the order: 
C(1)of (2)division (3) multiplication (4)addition (5)subtraction. 
 
KII. Modulus of a real number : Modulus of a real number a is defined as  
     |a| ={a, if a>0 
    -a, if a<0 
! Thus, |5|=5 and |-5|=-(-5)=5. 
XIII. Virnaculum (or bar): When an expression contains Virnaculum, before applying the 
F‚ÄòBODMAS‚Äô rule, we simplify the expression under the Virnaculum.

Wthe remaining one digit is called a period.                                22     47 
Now, 1
2
I = 1. On subtracting, we get 0 as remainder.                        44 
WNow, bring down the next period i.e., 47.                               241      313 
VNow, trial divisor is 1 x 2 = 2 and trial dividend is 47.                       241 
WSo, we take 22 as divisor and put 2 as quotient.                    2423        7269 
jThe remainder is 3.                                                                                7269 
VNext, we bring down the next period which is 13.                                  x 
;Now, trial divisor is 12 x 2 = 24 and trial dividend is  
7313. So, we take 241 as dividend and 1 as quotient.  
The remainder is 72.  
'Bring down the next period i.e., 69. 
9Now, the trial divisor is 121 x 2 = 242 and the trial  
6dividend is 7269. So, we take 3as quotient and 2423 
*as divisor. The remainder is then zero.

 
eIn this section, questions involving a set of numbers are put in the form of a puzzle. You have to 
[analyze the given conditions, assume the unknown numbers and form equations accordingly, 
.which on solving yield the unknown numbers. 
 
 SOLVED EXAMPLES  
 
REx.1.  A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the number. 
YSol.    Let the number be x. Then, x - 36 = 86 - x  => 2x = 86 + 36 = 122 => x = 61.   
(    Hence, the required number is 61. 
 
TEx. 2. Find a number such that when 15 is subtracted from 7 times the number, the 
NResult is 10 more than twice the number.           (Hotel Management, 2002) 
KSol.    Let the number be x. Then, 7x - 15 = 2x + 10 => 5x = 25 =>x = 5. 
(     Hence, the required number is 5. 
SEx. 3. The sum of a rational number and its reciprocal is 13/6. Find the number. 
(S.S.C. 2000) 
 Sol.     Let the number be x. 
 Then, x + (1/x) = 13/6 => (x
2
 + 1)/x = 13/6 => 6x
2
 ‚Äì 13x + 6 = 0 
    => 6x
72 ‚Äì 9x ‚Äì 4x + 6 = 0 => (3x ‚Äì 2) (2x ‚Äì 3) = 0 
? x = 2/3 or x = 3/2 
+Hence the required number is 2/3 or 3/2. 
  
TEx. 4. The sum of two numbers is 184. If one-third of the one exceeds one-seventh 
.of the other by 8, find the smaller number. 
<       Sol.     Let the numbers be x and (184 - x). Then, 
T (X/3) - ((184 ‚Äì x)/7) = 8 => 7x ‚Äì 3(184 ‚Äì x) = 168 => 10x = 720 => x = 72. 
D      So, the numbers are 72 and 112. Hence, smaller number = 72. 
 
`Ex. 5. The difference of two numbers is 11 and one-fifth of their sum is 9. Find the numbers. 
,Sol.     Let the number be x and y. Then, 
e            x ‚Äì y = 11      ----(i)     and 1/5 (x + y) = 9  => x + y = 45              ----(ii) 
d           Adding (i) and (ii), we get: 2x = 56 or x = 28. Putting x = 28 in (i), we get: y = 17. 
0            Hence, the numbers are 28 and 17. 
 
QEx. 6. If the sum of two numbers is 42 and their product is 437, then find the 
:absolute  difference between the numbers. (S.S.C. 2003) 
FSol.      Let the numbers be x and y. Then, x + y = 42 and xy = 437 
"            x - y = sqrt[(x + y)
2
 - 4xy] = sqrt[(42)
2
5 - 4 x 437 ] = sqrt[1764 ‚Äì 1748] = sqrt[16] = 4. 
      Required difference = 4. 
UEx. 7. The sum of two numbers is 16 and the sum of their squares is 113. Find the  
numbers. 
7         Sol.     Let the numbers be x and (15 - x). 
          Then, x
2

           =>       2x
2
" - 30x + 112 = 0         =>    x
2
 - 15x + 56 = 0 
P           =>       (x - 7) (x - 8) = 0             =>      x = 7  or  x = 8. 
*           So, the numbers are 7 and 8. 
 
YEx. 8. The average  of  four consecutive even numbers is 27. Find the largest of these 
numbers. 
OSol.     Let the four consecutive even numbers be x, x + 2, x + 4 and x + 6. 
:           Then, sum of these numbers = (27 x 4) = 108. 
Q           So, x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) = 108  or  4x = 96  or  x = 24. 
*      :. Largest number = (x + 6) = 30.

numbers.  
;         Sol.     Let the numbers be x, x + 2 and x + 4. 
           Then, X

2
 + 12x - 2511 = 0 
            =>     X
2
6 + 4x - 837 = 0 => (x - 27) (x + 31) = 0 => x = 27. 
=            Hence, the required numbers are 27, 29 and 31. 
 
cEx. 10. Of two numbers, 4 times the smaller one is less then 3 times the 1arger one by 5. If the 
Zsum of  the numbers is larger than 6 times their difference by 6, find the two numbers. 
@         Sol.     Let the numbers be x and y, such that x > y 
a           Then, 3x - 4y = 5 ...(i)  and  (x + y) - 6 (x - y) = 6 =>  -5x + 7y = 6     ‚Ä¶(ii) 
@            Solving (i) and (ii), we get: x = 59 and  y = 43. 
9            Hence, the required numbers are 59 and 43. 
 
QEx. 11. The ratio between a two-digit number and the sum of the digits of that 
gnumber is 4 : 1.If the digit in the unit's place is 3 more than the digit in the ten‚Äôs place, what 
is the number? 
DSol.      Let the ten's digit be x. Then, unit's digit = (x + 3). 
Z            Sum of the digits = x + (x + 3) = 2x + 3. Number = l0x + (x + 3) = llx + 3. 
[            11x+3 / 2x + 3  = 4 / 1 => 1lx + 3 = 4 (2x + 3)    =>  3x = 9      => x = 3. 
5            Hence, required number = 11x + 3 = 36. 
 
\Ex. 12. A number consists of two digits. The sum of the digits is 9. If 63  is subtracted 
Afrom the number, its digits are interchanged. Find the number. 
DSol.      Let the ten's digit be x. Then, unit's digit = (9 - x). 
/            Number = l0x + (9 - x) = 9x + 9. 
R            Number obtained by reversing the digits = 10 (9 - x) + x = 90 - 9x. 
Atherefore, (9x + 9) - 63 = 90 - 9x    => 18x = 144   => x = 8. 
8            So, ten's digit = 8 and unit's digit = 1. 
0            Hence, the required number is 81. 
ZEx. 13. A fraction becomes 2/3 when 1 is added to both, its numerator and denominator.  
ZAnd ,it becomes 1/2 when 1 is subtracted from both the numerator and  denominator. Find 
the fraction. 
4Sol.      Let the required fraction be x/y. Then, 
T x+1 / y+1 = 2 / 3  =>  3x ‚Äì 2y = - 1   ‚Ä¶(i) and   x ‚Äì 1 / y ‚Äì 1 = 1 / 2  
? 2x ‚Äì y = 1 ‚Ä¶(ii) 
/Solving (i) and (ii), we get : x = 3 , y = 5 
'therefore, Required fraction= 3 / 5.

dEx. 14. 50 is divided into two parts such that the sum of their reciprocals is 1/ 12.Find the two 
	parts. 
2Sol.      Let the two parts be x and  (50 - x). 
`            Then, 1 / x + 1 / (50 ‚Äì x) = 1 / 12 => (50 ‚Äì x + x) / x ( 50 ‚Äì x) = 1 / 12  
                    => x
2
H ‚Äì 50x + 600 = 0 => (x ‚Äì 30) ( x ‚Äì 20) = 0 => x = 30 or x = 20. 
So, the parts are 30 and 20. 
 
VEx. 15. If three numbers are added in pairs, the sums equal 10, 19 and 21. Find the 
numbers     ) 
2Sol.       Let the numbers be x, y and z. Then, 
K     x+ y = 10 ...(i) y + z = 19 ...(ii)       x + z = 21       ‚Ä¶(iii) 
QAdding (i) ,(ii) and (iii), we get:  2 (x + y + z ) = 50 or  (x + y + z) = 25. 
CThus, x= (25 - 19) = 6;  y = (25 - 21) = 4;  z = (25 - 10) = 15.

 
V1. Concept of Percentage : By a certain percent ,we mean that many hundredths. Thus 
/x percent means x hundredths, written as x%. 
 
6To express x% as a fraction : We have , x% = x/100. 
 
3Thus, 20% =20/100 =1/5; 48% =48/100 =12/25, etc. 
 
<To express a/b as a percent : We have, a/b =((a/b)*100)%. 
 
BThus, ¬º =[(1/4)*100] = 25%; 0.6 =6/10 =3/5 =[(3/5)*100]% =60%.

IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
u     I. RATIO: The ratio of two quantities a and b in the same units, is the fraction a/b and we write it as a:b.  
eIn the ratio a:b, we call a as the first term or antecedent and b, the second  term or consequent. 
 
IEx. The ratio 5: 9 represents 5/9 with antecedent = 5, consequent = 9. 
dRule: The multiplication or division of each term of a ratio by the same non-zero number does not 
affect the ratio. 
5Ex.  4: 5 = 8: 10 = 12: 15 etc. Also, 4: 6 = 2: 3. 
 
F    2. PROPORTION: The equality of two ratios is called proportion. 
pIf a: b = c: d, we write, a: b:: c : d and we say that a, b, c, d are in proportion . Here a and d are called 
1extremes, while b and c are called mean terms. 
+ Product of means = Product of extremes. 
,Thus, a: b:: c : d <=> (b x c) = (a x d). 
 
X3. (i) Fourth Proportional: If a : b = c: d, then d is called the fourth proportional 
 to a, b, c. 
Y   (ii) Third Proportional: If a: b = b: c, then c is called the third proportional to 
 a and b. 
U   (iii) Mean Proportional: Mean proportional between a and b is square root of ab 
 
4. (i) COMPARISON OF RATIOS: 
9        We say that (a: b) > (c: d) <=>  (a/b)>(c /d). 
 (ii) COMPOUNDED RATIO: 
L The compounded ratio of the ratios (a: b), (c: d), (e : f) is (ace: bdf)

 
I        Part filled by (A + B) In 1 hour =(1/36)+(1/45)=(9/180)=(1/20) 
 
I        Hence, both the pipes together will fill the tank in 20 hours. 
 
PEx. 2: Two pipes can fill a tank in 10hours and 12 hours respectively while a 
Pthird, pipe empties the full tank in 20 hours. If all the three pipes operate 
<simultaneously, in how much time will the tank be filled? 
 
FSol: Net part filled In 1 hour =(1/10)+(1/12)-(1/20)=(8/60)=(2/15).

E         Logarithms to the base 10 are known as common logarithms. 
 
ZIII. The logarithm of a number contains two parts, namely characteristic and mantissa.  
_Characteristic: The integral part of the logarithm of a number is called its characteristic. 
 
-Case I: When the number is greater than 1. 
\In this case, the characteristic is one less than the number of digits in the left of the 
%decimal point in the given number. 
 
+Case II: When the number is less than 1. 
\In this case, the characteristic is one more than the number of zeros between the decimal 
Kpoint and the first significant digit of the number and it is negative.  
GInstead of - 1, - 2, etc. we write, ?1 (one bar), ?2 (two bar), etc.

IMPORTANT FACTS 
 
[Races: A contest of speed in running, riding, driving, sailing or rowing is called race  
 
QCourse: The ground or path on which contests are made is called a race course. 
 
TStarting Point: The point from which a race begins is known as a starting point.  
 
VWinning Point or Goal: The point set to bound a race is called a winning paint or a 
	goal.  
 
NWinner: The person who first reaches the winning point is called a winner.  
 
[ Dead Heat Race: If all the persons contesting a race reach the goal exactly at the same 
6time, then the race is said to be a dead heat race. 
 
^Start: Suppose A and B are two contestants in a race. If before the start of the race, A is 
Zat the starting point and B is ahead of A by 12 metres, then we say that 'A gives  B, a 
start of 12 metres. ' 
WTo cover a race of 100 metres in this case, A will have to cover 100 metres while B  
will  
/have to cover only (100 - 12) = 88 metres. i 
\In a 100 m race, 'A can give B 12 m' or 'A can give B a start of 12 m' or 'A beats  12 m' 
;means that while A runs 100 m, B runs (100 - 12) = 88 m. 
  
UGames: 'A game of 100, means that the person among the contestants who scores 100m 
first is the winner. 
ZIf A scores 100 points while B scores only 80 points, then we say that 'A can give B 20 

points. 
 
 SOLVED EXAMPLES : 
 
JEx. 1. In a km race, A beats B by 28 metres or 7 seconds. Find A's time 
over the course. 
  
-Sol.  Clearly, B covers 28 m in 7 seconds. 
@:. B's time over the course = (278 x 1000) sec = 250 seconds. 
J:. A's  time over the course = (250 - 7-) sec = 243 sec = 4 min. 3 sec. 
 
WEx. 2. A  runs 1 ¬æ  times as fast as B. if A gives B a start of 84 m, bow far must  
Cwinning post be so that A and B might reach it at the same time? 
  
<Sol. Ratio of the rates of A and B =  7/4  : 1   = 7 : 4. 
+So, in a race of 7 m, A gains 3m over B. 
+:. 3 m are gained by A in a race of 7 m. 
=:. 84 m are gained by A in a race of (7/3 x 84) m = 196 m. 
>:. Winning post must be 196 m away from the starting point. 
 
 
REx. 3. A can run 1 km in 3 min. 10 sec. and B can cover the same distance in  3 
/min. 20 sec. By what distance can A beat B ? 
 
%Soln:Clearly, A beats B by 10 sec. 
<Distance covered by B in 10 sec. = (1000 x 10 )m = 50 m.  
!             200               
%Therefore  A beats B by 50 metres. 
 
 
TEx .4 . In a 100 m race, A runs at 8km  per hour. If A gives B a start of 4 m and 
4still him by 15 seconds, what is the speed of B ? 
  
MSol: Time taken by A to cover 100 m  =(60 X 60 / 8000) x 100 sec = 45 sec. 
>B covers (100 - 4) m  =  96 m   in  (45 + 15) sec = 60 sec. 
4B's speed  = (96 x 60 x 60  )km/hr = 5.76 km/hr.  
$                        60 x 1000 
 
 
XEx. 5. A, Band C  are three contestants in a km race. If A can give B a start of 40 m 
O    and A can give C  a start of 64m  how many metre's  start can B give C ? 
 
I     Sol:   While A covers 1000 m, B covers (1000 - 40) m = 960 m and  
(     C covers (1000 - 64) m or 936 m. 
( When B covers 960 m, C covers 936 m. 
  
S Ex 6. In a game of 80 points; A can give B 5 points  and C 15  points. Then how 
/many points  B can give C  in a game of 60 ? 
 
-Sol.    A: B = 80 : 75,   A : C = 80 : 65. 
IB/C  = ( B/ A *  A/C)  = (75 / 80 * 80 / 65)  = 15/13 = 60 /52 = 60: 5 
5Therfore ,In a game of 60, B can give C  8 points.

IMPORTANT FACTS AND FOAMULAE 
UUnder this heading we mainly deal with finding the day of the week on a particular 
Rgiven date the  process of finding it lies on obtaining the number of odd days. 
 
NOdd Days : Number of days more than the complete number of weeks in a given 
 
:Period ., is the number of odd days during that period. 
 
FLeapYear: Every year which is divisible by 4 is called a leap year. 
 
VThus each one of the years 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, etc. is a leap year. Every 
W4th century is a leap year but no other century is a leap year.thus each one of 400, 
/800, 1200,' 1600, 2000, etc. is a leap year. 
7None of 1900, 2010, 2020, 2100, etc. is a leap year. 
 
?An year which is not a leap year is called an ordinary year. 
 
E(I )An ordinary year has 365 days. (II) A leap  year has 366 days. 
 
Counting of Odd Days: 
 
5i)1 ordinary year = 365 days = (52 weeks + 1 day). 
%:. An ordinary year has 1 odd day. 
3ii)1 leap year = 366 days = (52 weeks + 2 days). 
!:. A leap year has 2 odd days. 
?_          iii)100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years 
>= [(76 x 52) weeks + 76 days) + [(24 x 52) weeks + 48 days] 
3= 5200 weeks + 124 days = (5217 weeks + 5 days). 
#:. 100 years contain 5 odd days. 
1200 years contain 10 and therefore 3 odd days. 
0300 years contain 15 and therefore 1 odd day. 
6400 years contain (20 + 1) and therefore 0 odd day. 
JSimilarly, each one of 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, etc. contains 0 odd days. 
FRemark: (7n + m) odd days, where m < 7 is equivalent to m odd days.

MSol. 16th April, 2000 = (1999 years + Period from 1st Jan., 2000 to 16thA' 
Counting of odd days: 
71600 years have 0 odd day. 300 years have 1 odd day. 
199 years = (24 leap years + 75 ordinary years) 
2= [(24 x 2) + (75 x 1)] odd days = 123 odd days 
&= (17 weeks + 4 days) = 4 odd days. 
Jan. Feb. March April 
>31 + 29 + 31 + 16 = 107 days = (15 weeks + 2 days) = 2 odd, 
KTotal number of odd days = (0 + 1 + 4 + 2) odd days = 7 odd days = 0 odd 
/day.   Hence, the required day was 'Sunday'.

st
  January 
:of  both the years must be on the same day of the week. 
SFor this, the number of odd days between 31st Dec., 2002 and 31st Dec.,2013 must 
be the same. 
TWe know that an ordinary year has 1 odd day and a leap year has 2 odd During this 
Speriod, there are 3 leap years, namely 2004, 2008 and 2012 and 8 ordinary years. 
7Total number of odd days = (6 + 8) days = 0 odd day.

IMPORTANT FACTS 
 
RThe Face or dial of a watch is a circle whose circumference is divided into 60  
&equal parts, called  minute spaces. 
PA clock  has two hands, the smaller one is called the hour hand or short hand 
@while the larger one is called the minute hand or long hand.. 
Gi) In 60 minutes, the minute hand gains 55 minutes on the hour hand. 
3ii) In every hour, both the hands coincide once. 
Wiii) The hands are in the same straight line when they are coincident or opposite to 
each other. 
Oiv) When the two hands are at right angles, they are 15 minute spaces apart. 
Qv)When the hand's are in opposite directions, they are 30 minute spaces apart. 
3 vi)Angle traced by hour hand in 12 hrs = 360¬∞. 
6vii)Angle traced by minute hand in 60 min. = 360¬∞. 
 
PToo Fast and Too Slow: If a watch or a clock indicates 8.15, when the correct 
.time , 8 is said to be 15 minutes too fast. 
XOn the other hand, if it indicates 7.45, when the correct time is 8, it is said to be 
15 minutes too slow. 
 
SOLVED EXAMPLES

 
SEx 2:At what time between 2 and 3 o'clock will the hands of a clock be together? 
 
XSolution: At 2 o'clock, the hour hand is at 2 and the minute hand is at 12, i.e. they 
are 10 min  spaces apart. 
KTo be together, the minute hand must gain 10 minutes over the hour hand. 
.Now, 55 minutes are gained by it in 60 min. 
A10 minutes will be  gained in (60 x 10)/55  min. = 120/11 min.

	angle? 
 
S Sol: At 4 o'clock, the minute hand will be 20 min. spaces behind the hour hand, 
RNow, when the two hands are at right angles, they are 15 min. spaces apart. So, 
3they are at right angles in following two cases. 
J       Case I. When minute hand is 15 min. spaces behind the hour hand: 
WIn this case min. hand will have to gain (20 - 15) = 5 minute spaces. 55 min. spaces

         
]       Sol: At 8 o'clock, the hour hand is at 8 and the minute hand is at 12, i.e. the two 
#hands_ are 20 min. spaces apart. 
XTo be in the same straight line but not together they will be 30 minute spaces apart. 
SSo, the minute hand will have to gain (30 - 20) = 10 minute spaces over the hour

  29. STOCKS AND SHARES 
 
ZTo start a big business or an industry, a large amount of money is needed. It is beyond 
Zthe capacity of one or two persons to arrange such a huge amount. However, some persons 
`associate together to form a company. They, then, draft a proposal, issue a prospectus(in the 
`name of company), explaining the plan of the project and invite the public to invest money in 
_this project. They, thus, pool up the funds from the public, by assigning them shares of the 
company. 
 
%      IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
S1. Stock-capital: The total amount needed to run the company is called the stock-

capital 
V2. Shares or stock: The whole capital is divided into small units, called shares or 
	stock. 
QFor each investment, the company issues a share-certificate, showing the value 
;of each share and the number of shares held by a person. 
RThe person who subscribers in shares or stock is called a share holder or stock 

holder. 
U3. Dividend: The annual profit distributed among share holders is called dividend. 
=Dividend is paid annually as per share or as a percentage. 
S4. Face Value: The value of a share or stock printed on the share-certificate is 
7called its Face Value or Nominal Value or Par Value. 
P5. Market Value: The stocks of different companies are sold and bought in the 
Popen market through brokers at stock-exchanges. A share (or stock) is said to 
be: 
D(i) At premium or Above par, if its market value is more than its 
face value. 
B(ii) At par, if its market value is the same as its face value. 
G(iii) At discount or Below par, if its market value is less than its 
face value. 
QThus, if a Rs.100 stock is quoted at a premium of 16, then market value of the 
"stock = Rs. (100+16) = Rs. 116. 
SLikewise, I f a Rs. 100 stock is quoted at a discount of 7, then market value of 
$the stock = Rs. (100-7) = Rs. 93. 
;6. Brokerage: The broker‚Äôs charge is called brokerage. 
E(i) When stock is purchased, brokerage is added to the cost price. 
D(ii) When stock is sold, brokerage is subtracted from the selling 
	price. 
Remember: 
9(i) The face value of a share always remains the same. 
>(ii) The market value of a share changes form time to time. 
>(iii) Dividend is always paid on the face value of a share. 
)(iv) Number of shares held by a person 
M=      Total Investment_ =    _Total Income    _  =      _Total Face Value 
Q    Investment in 1 share      Income from  1 share      face Value of 1 share 
 
5Thus, by a Rs. 100, 9% stock at 120, we mean that: 
+(i) Face Value (N>V) of stock = Rs. 100. 
.(ii) Market Value (M>V) of stock = Rs. 120. 
O(iii) Annual dividend on 1 share = 9% of face value = 9% of Rs. 100 = Rs. 9. 
A(iv) An investment of Rs. 120 gives an annual income of Rs. 9. 
J(v) Rate of interest p.a = Annual income from an investment of Rs. 100. 
*       =   (9/120 * 100) % = 7 (1/2) %.

YFactorial Notation: Let n be a positive integer.  Then, factorial n, denoted by n!  is 
defined as: 
                             
#  n! = n(n-1)(n-2)........3.2.1.

We define, 0! = 1. 
 
WPermutations:  The different arrangements of a given number of things by taking some 
-or all at a time, are called permutations. 
 
]Ex. 1.All permutations (or arrangements) made with the letters a, b, c by taking  two at a

 
HCor. Number of all permutations of n things, taken all at a time = n! 
 
ZAn Important Result: If there are n objects of  which p1 are alike of  one kind; p2 are 
balike of another kind; p3 are alike of third kind and  so on and pr are alike of rth kind, such 
that (p1+p2+.......pr) = n.

 
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS 
QBanker's Discount : Suppose a merchant A buys goods worth, say Rs. 10,000 from 
^another merchant B at a credit of say 5 months. Then, B prepares a bill, called the bill of 
Xexchange. A signs this bill and allows B to withdraw the amount from his bank account 
after exactly 5 months. 
[The date exactly after 5 months is called nominally due date. Three days (known as grace 
Bdays) are added to it to get a date, known as legally due date. 
 
VSuppose B wants to have the money before the legally due date. Then he can have the 
]money from the banker or a broker, who deducts S.I. on the face value (i.e., Rs. 10,000 in 
^this case) for the period from the date on which the bill was discounted (i.e., paid by the 
Ubanker) and the legally due date. This amount is known as Banker's Discount (B.D.) 
^Thus, B.D. is the S.I. on the face value for the period from the date on which the bill was 
'discounted and the legally due date. 
 
ABanker's Gain (B.G.) = (B.D.) - (T.D.) for the unexpired time.

IMPORTANT FACTS AND FORMULAE 
 
aThe pie-chart or a pie-graph is a method of representing a given numerical data in the form of 
sectors of a circle. 
gThe sectors of the circle are constructed in such a way that the area of each sector is proportional 
;to the corresponding value of the component of the data. 
YFrom geometry, we know that the area of a circle is proportional to the central angle. 
^So, the central angle of each sector must be proportional to the corresponding value of the 
component. 
FSince the sum of all the central angle is 360¬∞, we have            
Y                                                 Value of the component           ?

`1.(c):The total of the central angles corresponding to the three crops which cover 50% of the 
btotal area ,should be 180?.Now, the total of the central angles for the given combinations are: 
4(i)   Wheat,Barley and jowar = (72?+36?+18?)=126? 
2(ii)  Rice,Wheat and Jowar = (72?+72?+18?)=162? 
3(iii) Rice,Wheat and Barley = (72?+72?+36?)=180? 
4(iv)Bajra,Maize and Rice = (18?+45?+72?) = 135?   
-Clearly:(iii) is the required combination. 
 
i2.(a):   The area under any of the food crops is proportional to the angle corresponding to that crop. 
=Let the area under the rice production be x million acres.

f3.(b): Let the total production of barley be T tones and let Z acres of land be put under barley

O            And therefore,Area under wheat = 2*Area under Barley = (2Z)acres 


4And yield per acre for barley = (T/Z) tones/acre.

O?Area under rice production = 2 * area under barley production = (2Z) acres. 
NNow,if p tones be the yield per acre of barley then ,yield per acre of rice 
>                        =(p+50% of p) tones =(3/2 p) tones. 
I?Total production of rice = (yield per acre) * (area under production) 
G                                          =  (3/2 p)*2Z=(3pZ) tones.
